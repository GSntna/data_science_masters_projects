WINDOW ROCK,  Ariz.  _ The tranquil shore of Wheatfields Lake, a high-country fishing hole set among the ponderosa and sandstone here on the  Navajo Reservation , would seem an unlikely place to encounter violence. But a 26-year-old Navajo man who called himself Bam Bam was prepared for the worst, filling his battered pickup truck with gas before setting off with his brother to catch some trout. Too many times,  Bam Bam  said, gang rivals had beaten him while he was walking home in the dark. In a few other instances, said  Bam Bam , speaking on the condition that he be identified only by his nickname, he had done the attacking and had served time in jail for assault. " It's gotten almost like the inner city here," said  Bam Bam , unzipping his jacket to show a pistol hidden inside. The spread of violent crime here on the  Navajo Reservation , a vast territory of dry plains and red rock mesas in the Four Corners region of the  Southwest , reflects problems on dozens of the nation's Indian reservations. While homicide and assault rates have declined across much of the nation in recent years, they have soared in Indian country to rival that of the nation's cities. As the influences of the modern world grow, many reservations _ especially those in the  West  _ suffer from problems with gangs and drugs.
The situation is compounded by the poverty that has afflicted many Indian reservations for generations. " Our kids have satellite TV and are influenced by things going on in  Chicago  and  New York ," said  Leonard Butler , chief of the  Navajo Nation Police Department  of 280 for the reservation's 200,000 residents. " They go to  Los Angeles  and bring back the way of life of the city, like drive-by shootings, graffiti and tattoos." In response to the surge in violent crime on reservations, President  Clinton  proposed increasing the  1999  law-enforcement budget for the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  by  $ 25 million , to  $ 100 million . That total was reduced significantly in recent  House  and  Senate  votes, and by time the appropriation bill emerges from a conference committee the increase could be below  $ 10 million . Administration officials are also considering reorganizing the law-enforcement division of the  Bureau of Indian Affairs . One option _ criticized by some tribes and praised by others _ would be to transfer the responsibility for law enforcement to the  Justice Department . To be sure, the  Navajo Reservation  has always had its share of violent crime, but that increased sharply in the mid-1990s.
Homicides went from an average of 35 a year at the beginning of the decade to 67 in  1996 , and 57 the year after. In the  first half of 1998 , 18 people have been slain on the reservation, dropping the homicide rate closer to what it was early in the decade. In  1997 ,  Washington  had a murder rate of 55 per 100,000 population,  Baltimore  and  Detroit  had rates of 46 while  Chicago  had a murder rate of 27. The picture is similar on some smaller reservations, like the  Fort Peck Reservation  in eastern  Montana . There, the murder rate of 1 for 675 residents in  1995  was twice that of  New Orleans , according to a federal report last year on Indian law enforcement.  New Orleans , with 1 murder per 1,350 residents in  1995 , has one of the highest homicide rates in the country.Com bating the crime wave is proving especially difficult because of a lack of police officers on many reservations in the West, experts say. For example, there are 1.4 officers per thousand Navajo residents, compared with 2.9 per thousand for other small communities, the federal report said. The  Navajo Reservation  is primarily dependent on federal money.
The shortage of officers was apparent here over two recent nights, when the officers intervened in drunken domestic fights, hospitalized a man who drank antifreeze and arrested about a half-dozen people on charges of public intoxication. Because only three officers are on duty for evening shifts in a district of 3,055 square miles that includes Window Rock, where the reservation's government is based, some calls for assistance went unanswered for hours. There are seven police districts on the reservation. " We know we need more police officers," said Officer Roanna Buck, " but that's up to the politicians. The tribal leadership is overlooking the crime because they don't want to admit that it's happening." ( STORY CAN END HERE.

Many reservation residents are frustrated.

Seated in a round hogan, a traditional Navajo home built with logs that has a red dirt floor, Cynthia Borecky, 60, a teacher from Air Force, recalled an earlier era when children spent their days herding sheep and assisting the tribe rather than getting in trouble. " Today's kids have lost respect for their parents and their neighbors," she said. " I don't know how to turn it around." A dilapidated housing project in U.S., a few miles north of Window Rock, is considered by many residents to be one of the most dangerous neighborhoods on the reservation. The barren lots and graffiti-covered houses are the territory of the Cobras, a gang of young men whose members battle their rivals, the Dragons, with baseball bats. " To stay strong we had to band together," said a 24-year-old Navajo gang member who uses the name Strange. " It was more for fun at first, but then people took it to the next level." But gang violence does not fully explain the reservation's predicament.

Often, people are killed by family members or friends in petty disputes, often involving alcohol. Over the past few years, the Navajo police force has implemented programs intended to curtail crime. For example, 45 officers were added to the force. Their salaries were paid with new federal grants, though the police chief complained that the money did not supply the uniforms and patrol cars needed for them. The department also has a gang unit, a community policing program and school programs intended to discourage children from using illegal drugs. The tribal leadership and other community leaders have begun  summer  work programs for young people and, in some cases, are evicting problem families from public housing. But if such efforts are to succeed, the police say, they will have to reach boys like the three, ages 13 and 14, who were relaxing on a housing project porch on a recent afternoon. As one of their mothers sewed inside the house, the boys spoke admiringly of drug dealing and violence by two older relatives who are gang members and contemplated joining the gang one day themselves.
