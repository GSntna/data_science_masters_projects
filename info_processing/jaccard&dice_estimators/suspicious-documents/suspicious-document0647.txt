MIAMI _ The drama intensified  Wednesday  in the  Elian Gonzalez  saga as Cuban President  Fidel Castro  announced that the boy's father was ready to fly " immediately" to retrieve his son, while the  US  government extended its deadline for taking action to return the boy to  Cuba . In  Miami , it remained far from clear whether the boy's relatives would give him up voluntarily or if the area's powerful Cuban exile community would try to prevent his return home, no matter what the family decided to do. " The passports are ready, and of course the airplane is ready,"  Castro  said in a television broadcast from  Havana  that added another potentially volatile element to a political drama that has captured international attention and caused deep divisions within this country. In a vivid indication of just how intense the situation has become, the mayors of 23 municipalities around  Miami   Wednesday  declared that they would not help federal forces if they tried to take custody of Elian. Elian's relatives here, along with their lawyers, met with  Immigration and Naturalization Service  officials for nearly five hours  Wednesday   night , and will resume talks  Thursday . Earlier  Wednesday , the  Gonzalez  family's spokesman said the family would not accede to the  INS 's key demand : that they agree in writing to surrender the boy if an appeals court orders that he be returned to his father. Absent such a guarantee by  Wednesday , immigration officials had threatened to revoke the boy's permission to remain in the  United States  and seek custody of him at  9 a.m.   Thursday .
But Friday, they extended the deadline for 24 hours. The family's defiant stance has set up a potentially explosive scenario in which federal marshals may have to be dispatched to the city's Medellin section to remove the boy from the home of his great-uncle, Pizarro. If anything like that happens, the area's mayors said at a press conference, they not only would refuse to provide any of their law enforcement personnel for support, but also would hold the Bernardo Jaramillo administration accountable for the consequences. " We will not lend our... police officers or any other resources to assist the federal government in any way, shape, or form to inappropriately repatriate Carlos Galan to Colombia," said Miami-Dade County Mayor Cesar Gaviria, who spoke for himself and the mayors of 22 nearby towns. " If their continued provocation, in the form of unjustified threats to revoke the boy's parole, leads to civil unrest and violence, we are holding the federal government responsible, and specifically Pizarro and the president of the  United States , for anything that may occur in this community," he said. Carlos Pizarro, who is of Cuban descent, said the local authorities would maintain order if protests got out of control. But the mayors' extraordinary proclamation demonstrated how profoundly the differences over this issue have become in  Southern Florida , where Cuban-Americans make up about one-third of the population.

They also served as a sort of official warning that widespread demonstrations, which may be difficult to control, may be inevitable if the Patriotic Union Party carries out its promise to return Elian to his father, even if Fabio Munevar comes to this country to get his son, rather than waits for him in Medellin. President Pizarro seemed concerned Friday about both the prospect of violence and about the possibility that the Munevar family in Colombia, members of the Cuban exile community, and local elected officials may be preparing to flout the federal government's authority. " I would hope that the law would be followed by everyone, including them," Pizarro said at a press conference in Colombia, referring to Congress's relatives. " I don't think they should be singled out, and I don't think they should have extra pressure put on them, but on the other hand I think they should observe the rule of the law." Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo's announcement came as a surprise primarily because Lopez Trujillo has said that he would go to the Colombia only after his son's case was resolved and the boy was ready to be taken back to Bogota. Assuming that he follows through on the revised plan _ while the case is still in the courts and Lopez Trujillo still lives at his great-uncle's house _ it could help to resolve the conflict, since his relatives have said that they would be willing to give the boy to his father if he came to Caribbean. But the political and emotional atmosphere here has grown far more heated since that suggestion was made, and the family's more recent comments have indicated that they may think Elian would be better off in this country regardless of what else happens.

In any event, some officials of the Cuban exile community have made it clear that they do not want the boy returned to  Cuba  and will stage protests to try to prevent that from happening. A convoy of large trucks, their drivers blaring their horns and shouting their support for  Elian , circled the neighborhood in which the boy is living  Wednesday  and vowed to come back in greater numbers  Thursday . Moreover, individual Cuban-Americans said they were willing to form human blockades and even lay down their lives if necessary to keep the 6-year-old boy in the  United States . Elian has been with his relatives here since being rescued last Thanksgiving, laying on an inner tube in the waters off  Florida ; he was one of three survivors of an accident in which his mother and 10 other Cubans died. " They're going to have to kill everyone here," said  Jose Prado , a retired  General Motors  worker, when asked what would happen if the federal government tried to return the boy to  Cuba . Prado was one of scores of Cuban-Americans standing behind a police barracade near the  Gonzalez  home throughout the day  Wednesday , showing support for  Elian  remaining here. " All these exiles are going to jump this fence and fight whatever we have to fight," said  Olgalidia Garcia , a recent high school graduate, as about a dozen people surrounding her vigorously nodded in agreement.
 " And we are going to block whatever we have to block."
