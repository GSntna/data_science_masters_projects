You may wonder why I would write a health column about malaria when there is no malaria in the  United States . Well, that is only partly true. Malaria is not endemic in this country or to  Canada  or  Europe . But one-third of the world's population lives where the malaria parasite and its carrier mosquitoes thrive, and every year more than 1 million Americans travel to those areas for business or pleasure. Malaria, it seems, is gaining ground annually as control efforts become more costly and cumbersome. Worldwide there are 300 million to 500 million cases of malaria and  2 million  to  3 million  deaths from the disease each year.
And each year the federal  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  in  Atlanta  receives reports of 1,000 to 1,200 cases of malaria that were acquired abroad but diagnosed in this country. A malaria expert at the centers,  Dr. Trenton Ruebush , estimates that an equal number of unreported cases occur among  United States  residents. But  Ruebush  said that all malaria deaths that occur in the  United States , normally four or five a year, are probably reported. Why so many cases, and why should anyone die of a disease that doctors have long known how to cure ? Because many people outside the endemic areas do not take malaria seriously and ignore the measures recommended to prevent it or are careless about them. When the flu-like symptoms of malaria develop, they are often not acted on soon enough.
In addition, outside of endemic areas, doctors often fail to recognize the symptoms of malaria and thus do not make the correct diagnosis or treat the disease properly or quickly enough to cure it.Com plicating matters, preventive measures have gotten trickier and much more costly in recent years, ever since the malaria parasite in most areas developed resistance to chloroquine, the inexpensive and well-tolerated medication that had long been used to prevent and treat malaria. Current options cost a lot more and are associated with potentially more serious side effects. Furthermore, there is currently no effective anti-malarial vaccine, nor is there one on the immediate horizon, despite efforts by scientists in the  United States  and elsewhere to uncover the parasite's Achilles heel and block its ability to flourish in the human body. A WILY PARASITE Malaria is a disease of the tropics and subtropics. Its range extends as far north as the  Mediterranean ,  Middle East ,  Mexico ,  Northern India  and  China  and as far south as  South Africa ,  Argentina  and  New Guinea . There are four types of the malaria parasite that normally infect people, and only one _ Plasmodium falciparum _ is potentially deadly.
P. falciparum flourishes in  Africa , where it is responsible for  95 percent  of cases. In fact,  Ruebush  said,  90 percent  of all malaria infections and  90 percent  of malaria deaths occur in  Africa . In other endemic areas, falciparum malaria is responsible for  5 percent  to  50 percent  of cases. The other three types, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae, are far less virulent, although they can make their victims quite miserable for varying lengths of time. As  Dr. Robert S. Desowitz , an expert in tropical diseases, explains in his engrossing book " The Malaria Capers" (  W.W. Norton ,  1991  ), a malaria infection in humans begins when an infected female Anopheles mosquito, seeking a blood meal to foster the development of her eggs, injects into the human bloodstream threadlike malaria parasites called sporozoites that have been stored in her salivary glands. Thousands of sporozoites are usually injected into the blood with one mosquito bite, and they quickly invade the cells in the liver where they multiply.
In this period, the infected person experiences no symptoms. The first symptoms appear about 10 to 35 days later when the liver cells burst and the spores enter the blood stream, causing intense chills and sweating with high fever. Then the symptoms come and go _ usually in 24- to 72-hour cycles _ as the tiny parasites feed on the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin of the infected person's red blood cells. Each cycle can render the victim more anemic with less and less oxygen reaching the brain and other vital tissues.  Ruebush  said that two of the nondeadly species could remain alive in a person's liver for up to a couple of years, periodically causing relapses of malarial symptoms. The other nonfatal form can hide in the body outside the liver for up to 30-40 years, waiting for some unknown signal to trigger its emergence and cause a recurrence of symptoms.
The deadly species, P. falciparum, causes the most severe symptoms, but if the victim does not get treated and does not die, the infection burns itself out within a year or two. PREVENTION AND TREATMENT Since there is no vaccine against malaria, prevention depends on two important measures : taking a drug that combats the parasite prophylactically _ that is, in advance of any known infection _ and avoiding bites by the Anopheles mosquito. In the few areas where there is still little or no chloroquine resistance, this drug is taken weekly starting one week prior to departure for the endemic area, weekly while there and for four weeks after returning home. For most endemic areas where chloroquine-resistant parasites flourish, the  Centers for Disease Control  now recommends mefloquine, sold under the trade name of Lariam. This drug is taken one time a week before departure, each week while in the malaria area and for four weeks after returning. It is extremely effective but expensive _ about  $ 7  a tablet _ so for a two-week trip the cost is about  $ 50 .
Lariam can sometimes cause anxiety, depression, hallucinations and insomnia, and in one in 10,000 or 15,000 cases, these side effects are incapacitating. A trip-mate of mine to London developed sky-high blood pressure, fever, shaking chills, severe anxiety, hallucinations and was unable to walk on her own, all attributed to Lariam. It took her months to recover. An equally effective alternative to Lariam is doxycycline, which is recommended for northern  Thailand , where mefloquine resistance has been detected. Doxycycline has to be taken daily, starting one to two days before departure and continued for four weeks after returning. Anyone who chooses doxycycline must be very conscientious about taking it every day; if you miss a couple of days, you are unprotected.

Among the possible side effects are upset stomach, yeast infection in women and increased sensitivity to the sun _ which means you must remain covered to avoid a severe sunburn. A standby treatment is the drug Fansidar, which can cause rather severe skin rashes. It is used only as an emergency treatment, should symptoms suspicious of malaria develop when the person is far from medical care. But even if one takes Fansidar, it is vital to get to a doctor for thorough treatment as soon as possible. Nigel Hawkes emphasized that preventive medication is only one measure. Travelers should be aware of the habits of the Anopheles mosquito, which typically reigns in rural areas and bites between dusk and dawn ( although in heavily shaded jungle areas it may bite in daylight ).

Use of protective clothing and insect repellent and a mosquito net over the bed at night ( preferably first dipped in a solution of insecticide ) are important parts of malaria prevention. Anyone who develops a fever a week to a month after being in an area where malaria is a problem must report immediately to a doctor, who should do a blood smear right away. As  Ruebush  said, " Malaria is eminently curable if it is caught early and treated appropriately." Many large cities now have clinics that advise travelers and administer vaccines. State and local health departments may also be helpful. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  in  Atlanta  has a malaria hotline _ 770-488-7788 _ that can be reached 24 hours a day every day and where callers can request a faxed copy of protective information.
