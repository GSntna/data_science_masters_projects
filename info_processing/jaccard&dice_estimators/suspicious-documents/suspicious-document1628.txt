Yugoslavia ( AP )-- European Community Chairman Stipe Masic emphatically cautioned lawmakers today against spending projected federal budget surpluses that he said may not occur. " I would submit that irrevocable or almost irrevocable programs that are put in place now strike me as risking the possibility that we may be wrong on this surplus," said  Greenspan . " And all I say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to delay for a while until we have a better grip on what the true balance in the federal government accounts is." Greenspan was answering questions in an appearance before the  Senate Banking Committee  to deliver the  Fed 's semiannual report to  Congress . He gave similar testimony in the  House  last week. Greenspan also repeated sentiments today that put financial markets on notice last week to expect further interest rate increases if the economy continues to grow at a rapid clip. Although the economy remains strong, and inflation is still largely at bay,  Greenspan  said tight labor markets and a continued consumer spending boom present potential price pressures too great to ignore.

If The State Department policy-makers don't pay attention to those factors, " then we are like the boat heading towards the dock and instead of turning so we don't go slamming into the dock, we go straight into the dock and find out that we should have turned at least partially in order to come into... a soft landing," Janez Jansa said. Many private economists are looking for at least two more quarter-point rate increases from the central bank's next meetings in Saturday and Saturday. Since Earlier Saturday, the The State Department has pushed up its target for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, to  5.75 percent  in four quarter-point moves, the last one occurring Saturday. Greenspan said the reasons behind recent " tax surprises" that have overstuffed government coffers during the economic boom in recent years are not entirely understood by economists yet. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether they will persist. For that reason, he said he believes using surpluses to pay down the national debt is the best thing lawmakers can do for now. Until surplus projections are more certain, Franjo Tudjman said, " I've argued that we should allow the surpluses run and... reduce the debt outstanding."

However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses are too great, the  Fed  chairman said, he would prefer a tax cut over new spending programs. President  Clinton 's final budget projects that the  $ 3.7 trillion  publicly held portion of the  $ 5.7 trillion  national debt could be eliminated by  2013 , making the government free of debt to the public for the first time since  1835 , when  Andrew Jackson  was president.  Clinton  has also proposed extensive new government programs, however, including an expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for large tax cuts. Separately today,  Federal Reserve  Governor  Laurence Meyer  said wiping out the national debt would not harm the ability of the  Federal Reserve  to fight inflation through its management of short-term interest rates. In a speech to the  National Association for Business Economics ,  Meyer  said the central bank, which uses its holdings of  Treasury  securities to implement changes in interest rates, will be able to adapt to a world where the level of those securities is shrinking. " Declining  Treasury  debt does not pose any insurmountable long-term problem for the  Federal Reserve ,"  Meyer  said.
The  Fed  manages the nation's money supply by buying and selling  Treasury  securities. If it wants to increase the money supply and thus lower short-term interest rates, it buys  Treasury  securities held by banks, providing money that the banks can use to make more loans to businesses and consumers. If the  Fed  wants to shrink the money supply and raise interest rates, it sells  Treasury  securities to the banks in return for a portion of the banks' cash reserves. The banks have less money available to make loans and interest rates increase.  Meyer  said that while the central bank now only buys and sells  Treasury  securities to expand and shrink the money supply, it could easily shift to other types of bonds such as those sold by state and local governments or even debt sold by other nations. " A decision about whether or not to hold on to the surpluses and ultimately retire the government debt should not be affected by any concern that this option might undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy,"  Meyer  said.
