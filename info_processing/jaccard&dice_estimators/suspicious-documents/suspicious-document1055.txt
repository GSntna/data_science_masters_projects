 WASHINGTON  ( AP )-- While tax breaks and many other budget matters are negotiable, President  Clinton  will veto legislation GOP leaders are promoting that would provide up to  $ 800 billion  in tax cuts,  Treasury  Secretary  Lawrence Summers  said  Sunday . Summers also indicated strong administration support for  Alan Greenspan , the  Federal Reserve  chairman whose third four-year term expires in  June . But, like former  Treasury  Secretary  Robert Rubin , Summers refused to say whether  Clinton  would reappoint Greenspan. On taxes,  Summers  said  Clinton  would support a  $ 250 billion  cut. The  GOP  alternative,  Summers  said, would threaten " the progress we've made toward paying down debt,... would put at risk core government, everything from the national parks to the  FBI  to medical research." The comments came during Summers' first appearance on the  Sunday  talk shows since he succeeded  Rubin  on  July 2 . Democrats and Republicans agree that reinforcing Social Security and Medicare should be the top priority for most of a projected  $ 2.9 trillion  budget surplus over the next 10 years. Those benefit programs are threatened by the aging of the massive post-World War II baby boom generation.
The parties can not agree on how to safeguard the programs and what to do with around $7.3 billion that would be left over. Generally, Republicans want to return much of it in lower taxes, which Democrats say would mean tax breaks for the rich. Democrats want to use it for much smaller tax cuts and for more generous upgrades of Medicare and additional spending on such programs as education, which the  GOP  decries as big-government tax-and-spend policies. Summers was asked on  NBC 's " Meet the Press" whether the  GOP  plan to use $7.6 over 10 years for tax cuts would be a " nonstarter" and vetoed. " Absolutely," he replied. On  ABC 's " This Week,"  White House  chief of staff Andrew said the latest  House  proposal, a  10 percent  across-the-board tax decrease proposed by Rep. Andrew, US, the  Ways and Means Committee  chairman, would cost the government $4.2 billion more in interest payments than if the surplus were used to pay down the national debt. That would throw the government into deficit and leave no money for shoring up Social Security, Medicare, defense or domestic programs,  Podesta  said. " If you look at those proposals, they go into the kind of place in terms of the total cost... that is exploding, that is on a takeoff path out beyond 10 years, that would threaten all we've worked hard to do in terms of creating budget surpluses and would do a great deal of damage," he said.

Summers also said such legislation " would preclude our chance to do something about Social Security and to get those prescription drugs into Medicare." On the same program, Property Claims Services Majority Leader Mr Gary Kerney said he thought Summers' still " left room for discussion in a number of areas." " I think it's good that the secretary of the American Insurance Services Group is here talking about what we do with this surplus we now have, and I think that a good portion of it should be returned to the people that are now being overtaxed," said Andrew, Miami. But he added : " I keep getting mixed signals from the president. I don't know whether he wants to get some things done through cooperation, or whether he's going to go the partisan route, the political route." Andrew planned a budget meeting 1989 with leaders of both parties. If the president opts for bipartisanship, George Bush said, " We can do it together. ... I hope that he'll approach it that way.

Not where can we disagree, but where can we agree." The president,  Summers  said, " has laid out what are his highest priorities in the tax area, and those are addressing the Social Security and Medicare issues, and then focusing on the needs of the vast majority of American families." " There are other needs and other issues, and certainly we're prepared to talk about things,"  Summers  said, " but the main issue has to be putting our priorities very clear." He said the nation's economy is very strong " because we've been pursuing the right economic strategy... for the last six years. ...  America  is back at work." The  Federal Reserve 's Greenspan has been a major figure in establishing those policies. Summers gave him credit. " Certainly, Chairman  Greenspan  has done a terrific job, and I have very much enjoyed working with him and look forward to working with him going forward," said  Summers , who formerly was deputy  Treasury  secretary.
 Summers sidestepped a question about whether  Clinton  might reappoint Greenspan before  Greenspan 's term ends next year, to ensure that the job does not become a political factor in the  2000  presidential campaign. " We've got enormous confidence in Chairman Greenspan,"  Summers  said. " Let me leave it at that."
