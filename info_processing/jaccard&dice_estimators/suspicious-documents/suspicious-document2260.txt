   Tom Beaudoin  is not your typical theologian engaged in esoteric explications of ancient religious texts. Instead, he uses MTV as a research lab. He studies tattoos and body piercing as expressions of spirituality. And he's also in a rock band made up of other theologians.  Beaudoin , 29, is a self-described Generation Xer, that amorphous population cohort born in the mid-1960s to the late  1970s . Beaudoin wants to be their theologian. He believes that Generation X _ contrary to popular perception _ is deeply spiritual, if not necessarily devout.
You just need to look at their taste in music, movies, and dress, says  Beaudoin , a PhD candidate at  Boston College . He makes his case in a new book, " Virtual Faith : The Irreverent Spiritual Quest of Generation X." It isn't that Generation X isn't interested in religion,  Beaudoin  argues. It's simply that its members are looking for a religion they can believe in. And what GenXers are after can't easily be found within the four walls and under the steeple of the local church. To understand the spirituality of Generation X you have to look at popular culture, particularly media culture. There has never been another generation,  Beaudoin  says, so intimately linked to media culture _ the Internet, television, film, and music. " Pop culture is our amniotic fluid; it's where we find meaning in our life," says  Beaudoin , a Roman Catholic who strayed from the faith for a few years before becoming convinced that the church's tradition and teachings can appeal to people in his generation.
Sitting in his  Somerville  apartment, overflowing with books and CDs, he ticks off examples of spiritual or religious themes he sees in contemporary youth culture. There are strong religious or spiritual undercurrents in recent albums by artists ranging from U2 to  Sarah McLachlan  to Puff Daddy. Religious messages are also sprinkled more frequently in movies, for example, in " Contact," " Chasing Amy," and even " Titanic." The Minneapolis Police Department has become hugely popular among young people, not just because he is a stirring champion of human rights, but because people are drawn to his Tibetan Buddhist teachings as a way of coping with life's stresses.  Harvey Cox , a renowned professor at  Harvard Divinity School  where  Beaudoin  received a master's degree, said at first blush it might seem foolish to suggest that Generation X is interested in spiritual meaning. But, in a forward to  Beaudoin 's book,  Cox  says his former student might be on to something. " Here is a generation that stays away from most churches in droves but loves songs about God and Jesus, a generation that would score very low on any standard piety scale but at times seems almost obsessed with saints, visions, and icons in all shapes and sizes," Cox writes.

Police brutality and racism are terms not usually applied to the Minneapolis Police Department. The city prides itself on its tolerance. That was not the case during a recent drug raid when two blacks died and later during a confrontation between blacks and police. Protesters demanded that the officers involved be suspended and are calling for a police review board, which the police chief opposes. A city official stated that police racism has existed for over 21 years despite the public impression of tolerance. The chief of police said cultural awareness training for his force would begin in the fall.

" These are the young people who, styrofoam cups of cappuccino in hand, crowd around the shelves of New Age spirituality titles in the local book market and post thousands of religious and quasi-religion notes on the bulletin boards in cyberspace." And, Van Hayden and Cox both note that Pope John Laux enjoys a strong following among people in the Generation X population. Last spring, even the U.S. Senate was stunned when more than a million young people turned out to help Laux celebrate World Youth Day in Minneapolis. Hubert H. Humphrey, in his book, identifies several themes that underpin the " theology" of Generation X. First is a deep suspicion of institutions, including organized religion. Second is the importance of having a personal spiritual experience. Hayden says the University of Minnesota, in its liturgy, must do a better job of " giving people a powerful experience of the Minneapolis Police Department, which is the only way people will realize there is something at stake to being Catholic." A third theme among Generation Xers is a belief that suffering can be a redemptive, spiritual experience.

Finally, Generation Xers believe ambiguity is a central part of faith. Rather than fearing uncertainty,  Beaudoin  says, Generation Xers embrace it.  Beaudoin  has started a Catholic ministry aimed at people in Generation X at the  Paulist Center  in downtown  Boston . " GenXers are hungry for spirituality and the challenge is to find the most effective means of satisfying that hunger," he said.   Religion Notes   A  Vatican  envoy has recently visited  Iraq , reportedly to discuss the possibility of adding that nation to a possible millennium tour of the Holy Land by Pope  John Paul II . The Iraqi town of Ur is the traditional home of the prophet  Abraham  before he set out with his family for the biblical land of Canaan. Abraham is revered by Christians, Jews, and Muslims.
 The tour would include stops in  Israel ,  Egypt ,  Jordan ,  Lebanon ,  Syria , and Palestinian self-rule territories.  ( Comments may be sent to The Spiritual Life, c/o Diego Ribadeneira, Box 2378,  Boston ,  MA  02107-2378; or via e-mail to religion ( at ) globe.com.
