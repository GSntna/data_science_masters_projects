 JONESBORO ,  Ark.  ( AP )-- A year after two heavily armed boys pulled a fire alarm and shot students filing out of  Westside Middle School , killing four girls and a teacher, the superintendent talks about keeping a " cloak of safety" around his 75-acre campus. Shrubs are cut back and a wooden fence now sets off the campus. A uniformed officer teaches  Arkansas  criminal law and acts as student confidante. School counselors are on duty every day. The district is functioning normally, says Superintendent  Dick Young , though it doesn't use alarms for fire drills anymore. He won't allow visitors in the hallways, saying children may be reminded what happened  March 24, 1998 .
" We're in that gulf between wanting to remember and wanting to forget," Young says. Students  Natalie Brooks ,  Paige Ann Herring ,  Stephanie Johnson  and  Britthney Varner  and teacher  Shannon Wright  were cut down in the brief outburst of gunfire. A memorial garden is being built at the spot where they fell. The shootings in  Jonesboro  and at schools in  Pearl ,  Miss. ;  West Paducah ,  Ky. ;  Edinboro ,  Pa. ;  Fayetteville ,  Tenn. ;  Springfield ,  Ore. ; and  Richmond ,  Va. , alarmed the nation last year. President  Clinton  called the outbreak " a terrible tragedy" and noted " the awful specter of students being killed by other young people at schools."  Ronald Stephens  of the California-based  National School Safety Center  told a  House  subcommittee after the  Jonesboro  shootings : " It should not require an act of courage for parents to send their children to school."
On  Wednesday , the first anniversary of the  Jonesboro  shootings, Rep.  Carolyn McCarthy ,  D-N.Y. , plans to introduce for a second time the Children's Gun Violence Prevention Act. The legislation never came to a vote last year.  McCarthy  says the bill would help prosecute people who sell guns to children, require gun owners to keep guns away from children and finance violence awareness programs in schools. In the  Senate ,  Richard Durbin ,  D-Ill. , and  John Chafee ,  R-R.I. , will make another run at the  Child Access Prevention  bill. The bill holds adults liable when children use improperly stored firearms to kill or injure others.
 Stephens  says some 20 states have laws calling for school safety plans and many have set up hot lines for anonymous tips on disturbing behavior by students, tightened access to campuses and improved screening for school visitors. " In my view, the schools are safer than they were a year ago because we've had a heightened need to be vigilant," he says.  Suzann Wilson , who lost her 11-year-old daughter,  Britthney , knows of the changes at Westside but says more should be done to make students feel safe. Class sizes should be smaller, students should be taught how to deal with their anger and schools should have more counselors.  Wilson  says her 14-year-old daughter,  Brandi , is still afraid to go to school. And for  Wilson 's part, " there's not a day goes by that I don't think that she's going back to where her sister got killed," she says.
In  Mississippi , where  Pearl High School  student Ben Johnson was convicted of killing two classmates and wounding seven others after first killing his mother Sept. 24, 1988, the  Legislature  passed a law broadening the death penalty to include killings on school campuses. In  Kentucky , student  Michael Carneal  received a life sentence after pleading guilty but mentally ill in the shooting deaths of three students at  Heath High School  near  Paducah  on 1987.  McCracken County School District , home to  Heath High , now posts armed security guards, requires student identification tags and searches for weapons in its schools. In  Lexington ,  Ashland  and other places, anonymous tip lines were set up to report guns or drugs brought to schools. In  Virginia , where 14-year-old Quinshawn Booker wounded a teacher and a 74-year-old school volunteer last Friday, Gov.  Jim Gilmore  has released  $ 1.5 million  to put some 45 additional police officers in schools. Richmond schools ordered teachers to step up hallway patrols, and some school districts installed surveillance cameras.

Booker pleaded guilty to five counts and was required to complete a program at a school for troubled youths, then be on probation until age 21. Johnson has forcefully lobbied the Alachua County Legislature to hold gun owners liable if they leave unlocked guns where children can get them. She also wants to prohibit juveniles from owning guns after their release from detention centers. A heated exchange with gun advocates on the state Capitol steps February 1987 brought Ben to tears. But the confrontation did not diminish her resolve. " It keeps me directed," Ben says.

" It's something to focus on. If I didn't have this, then I would have to stop and think about what I lost." While Arkansas legislators debated her proposals and other measures,  Andrew Golden , 12, and  Mitchell Johnson , 14, remained in custody at a juvenile prison 20 minutes away. The boys, 11 and 13 at the time of the shootings, were found delinquent in the five killings and the wounding of 10 others. They are due to be released at age 18. " We really have not had any major problems with either boy.
 They have not been difficult juveniles for us," says  Joe Quinn , spokesman for the  Human Services Department , which oversees juvenile corrections. Jonesboro is marking the sad anniversary with two gatherings at  12:40 p.m. , the time of the shootings-- one at the school, the second at the courthouse.  Wilson  says  Brandi  will sing at the courthouse, and afterward the family will visit the cemetery where Britthney is buried.
