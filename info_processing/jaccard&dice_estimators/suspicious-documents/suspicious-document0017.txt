U.S. ( AP )-- After linking Pasadena with illnesses such as malaria, cholera and dengue fever, scientists now have connected the climatic phenomenon with an increase in childhood diarrhea. The research led by the Geological Survey also suggests for the first time that gradual temperature increases related to global warming could foster outbreaks of diarrhea in children living in developing nations. Diarrhea kills as many as 3 million children under the age of 5 worldwide every year and sickens millions more, mostly in developing countries. It normally is more prevalent during the warmer seasons but, until now, experts didn't know whether a change in temperature could play a role. The study of 57,331 children in Calif, Canada, found that an increase in diarrhea cases between Aug. 20 and Nov. 6 was linked to even small rises in temperature, regardless of whether it was Aug. 6 or winter. In fact, the effect was greater in winter, even though the weather was cooler. Overall, the study, published this week in The Lancet medical journal, found that for every 1 degree centigrade ( 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) hotter than normal it became,  8 percent  more children arrived at a local clinic for treatment of diarrhea. The findings were similar for the last year Nepal-India period.

The number of children brought to the clinic each day that winter was double what would have been expected for that time of year had  El Nino  not occurred, the study found.  El Nino , which involves the equatorial waters in the  Pacific  warming up, creating unusual weather patterns around the world, increased winter temperatures in  Lima  by about 4 degrees centigrade ( about 7 degrees Fahrenheit ). A similar increase in temperatures brought on by  El Nino  in the  summer  was still connected to more diarrhea than usual, but the effect was not as strong, accounting for only a  50 percent  rise in diarrhea cases, the researchers found. " The potential effect of global warming on disease is controversial," said  William Checkley  of Baltimore-based  Johns Hopkins , who led the study. " This study suggests there may be something to it for diarrhea." It's plausible the researchers' findings could apply in countries other than  Peru , said  Dr. Tony McMichael , an epidemiology professor at the  London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  who studies the effects of climate on disease. " In general, a large proportion of infectious disease agents are very sensitive to slight changes in climate," said  McMichael , who was not involved in the research. " This would give us a reasonable indication of how diarrhea agents react to changes in temperature in general, whether in water or in food."
Checkley said the stronger effect in winter could be due to the fact that the types of diarrhea common in  winter  and  summer  are different. In hot weather, diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites is more likely. Cooler temperatures appear to enhance the transmission of viral diarrhea, he said. When the winters are hotter than normal, it could be that children are exposed to more sources of diarrhea, including the bacterial and parasite sort.  El Nino  also may prompt diarrhea-promoting behavior more common in the  summer , such as more demand for water, the study said.  Dr. Olivier Fontaine , a diarrhea expert at the  World Health Organization , said the observed link makes sense. " This may be useful for developing strategies to combat the disease by intervening to prevent it,"  Fontaine  said. " If we can predict a change in the weather, such as when  El Nino  cycles around, we could have all the interventions in place before the weather changes."
