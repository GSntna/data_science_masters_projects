 TOPEKA ,  Kan.  _ Struggling to avoid a deadlock, the 10  Kansas Board of Education  members on  Wednesday  left hanging the question of whether to accept science standards designating evolution as the foundation of biology. The standards, written by a state committee of science teachers and university professors, would determine what Kansas schoolchildren learn and are tested on. They list evolution as one of five unifying concepts linking all science disciplines. A competing set of standards presented by conservative board member  Steve Abrams  on  Wednesday  would remove the emphasis on evolution and insert " the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer." Those standards were written by " various citizens," including members of a local creation-science group. For two hours the board questioned the state committee and  Abrams .
Some board members questioned why the committee based its work on standards written by a national science group. Others asked  Abrams , of  Arkansas City , why he did not include the names of the people who wrote his proposal; the only names on the document were those of the science committee members. As the discussion ended, board Chairwoman  Linda Holloway  of  Shawnee  said she was unwilling to put the matter to a vote when it was clear that board opinions were split. " The decision rests with this board, and this is where the wrestling will have to come,"  Holloway  said. " The responsibility ultimately rests with these 10 members." According to the board's schedule, the board is to vote on the standards in  June .
But  Holloway  said she was sure the board would not be ready to vote that soon. The debate stems from a  1997  vote by the board for new standards in all subject areas. The science standards committee, appointed in part by board members, has met 12 times since  last June , co-chairman  Loren Lutes  of  Elkhart  told the board. Lutes, superintendent of the  Elkhart School District , told the board that the committee used guidelines from the  National Academy of Sciences  to frame the  Kansas  standards.  Lutes  said those guidelines " represent, in our opinion, a consensus of what is right for science education." Before arriving at the state board for discussion, the proposed Kansas standards had been through eight public hearings and were reviewed by the  Council for Basic Education , based in  Washington .
The fourth draft reflected the group's criticisms and public comments,  Lutes  said.  Lutes  said his committee had reviewed the  Abrams  version and found a fundamental difference in how the two documents defined science. Board member  Scott Hill  of  Abilene , a conservative, said the differences were unclear.Com mittee member  Brad Williamson  said the difference lay in how the two sets of standards treated scientific theory. The committee's version says a theory such as evolution paints a big picture of how the natural world works. Abrams' proposal casts theory as conjecture, placing applied science above understanding how things work, said  Williamson , an  Olathe East High School  science teacher. " Science tries to figure out what's out there,"  Williamson  said.
" That's the point I'd like to share with my kids, and that's taken away from me in ( Thomas' ) document." Abrams, a veterinarian, said later in the discussion that he pushed for alternate standards because the committee's work did not reflect his view of good science. He said he did not find in the document his understanding that all scientific theories must be observable, measurable, testable and falsifiable. To him, evolution is none of these things. Abrams denied the accusations of several speakers who on  Tuesday  called his proposal an attempt to push religion into the schools. He said the proposal's intent in mentioning intelligent design was to acknowledge that more than one theory existed on life's origins.

Some members suggested that Mr. Thomas and the science committee work out a compromise. Lutes, the committee co-chairman, said he was unwilling to integrate the Judge Thomas proposal into the committee's standards. If the board asks him to, he will resign, and so will many committee members, Judge Thomas said. The committee meets Saturday in America to discuss its next step, Thomas said after the board meeting. " As long as the board continues to let us do our work, we're going to do it," Mr. Thomas said. " When the board takes over our job, we're going to give it to them."

The board members said repeatedly they wanted consensus on the standards. In the  last two years  the board has deadlocked along conservative-moderate lines over state tests, math standards and some federal programs. The 5-5 split continued after  November 's elections, but the board agreed in  January  to find common ground. In  March , for example, members unanimously approved new math standards almost a year after they appeared before the previous board. As the discussion  Wednesday  ended,  Holloway  spoke. She said one aspect of the  Abrams  proposal that touched her was a statement that " the cause of science or education ( can not ) be served well by censoring, ridiculing or in any other way discouraging students from proposing and defending alternate theories."
 In the board's open forum  Tuesday , some speakers accused  Holloway , a Christian conservative, of attempting to impose her religious beliefs on public education. " My faith was personally attacked yesterday,"  Holloway  said, her voice breaking. " I don't want that for any child in the state of  Kansas . " We see what ridicule can lead to in  Littleton . I don't want any child or staff member to be ridiculed because they have a faith that might be different from a prevailing theory."
