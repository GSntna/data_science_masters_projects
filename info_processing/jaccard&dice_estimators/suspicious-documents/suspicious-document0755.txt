By  KATE BEEM Knight Ridder Newspapers   KANSAS CITY ,  Mo.  _ Someone created every thing in the universe,  Celtie Johnson  believes. Someone made the pen she writes with. Someone made the keyboard she types on. All complex systems are designed by someone, so it follows that life, the most complex system of all, has a designer, too, said  Johnson , of  Prairie Village ,  Kan . " No one's saying who that intelligent designer is," she said. To  Johnson , evolution simply makes no sense. She rejects the evidence most scientists say supports the theory that all living things share common ancestors. She firmly believes in the biblical account of creation. Early this year she mounted a campaign to turn the  Kansas  science community on its ear. Judging from the agitation in the state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded :- In the beginning, the  Kansas Board of Education  and the state education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science teachers and professors to write new science standards for public schools. The committee's version described the theory of evolution as a " unifying concept" for all science disciplines. It drew objections from those who do not believe in evolution. Late  last winter ,  Johnson  pulled together a loosely knit group of creationists from  Kansas  and  Missouri  who drafted an alternate version of the standards. The alternate draft, presented to the state board, defined both evolution and creation in its glossary.
It also defined the battle that would occupy the state board for months. -  Johnson  visited the  Kansas  board again and again, urging members to reject the committee's science standards in favor of her group's standards. - She also formed the  National Committee for Excellence in Science Education , which helps people in other states who want to question evolution. The group intends to offer the alternate science standards written by  Johnson  and others to people in other states.  Steve Abrams , a conservative  Kansas Board of Education  member from  Arkansas City ,  Kan. , presented the alternate standards  Johnson  helped write. " She was very dedicated and wants to see good science in  Kansas ," said  Abrams , a veterinarian.  Val DeFever , a moderate board member from Independence,  Kan. , said  Johnson  was determined to sway board members to her point of view. " I just explained to her we weren't on the same wavelength," said  DeFever , who supported the standards written by the science teachers. " We were both committed to our viewpoints, and it really would be a waste of time." Johnson says she wanted scientists to explain why, as she sees it, evolution is immune from question and why other explanations for the origins of life can not be considered in science classes. " I admire her dedication," said  Ken Ham , executive director of the creationist organization  Answers in Genesis , based in  Kentucky . " I admire her trying to do these things." Johnson's critics say that, under the guise of science, she is trying to inject into the public schools her religious belief that God created the universe.  John van Keppel  of  Leawood ,  Kan. , an evolution supporter, says  Johnson  does not understand science well enough to dispute the facts of evolution.
The evidence against evolution that  Johnson  and other creationists say is being censored by mainstream science is a cut-and-paste job, said  Charlotte McDonald , the  Blue Valley School District 's science coordinator. " She is not presenting the whole scientific information,"  McDonald  said. " If you're going to take things out of context, you can refute anything you want to refute." Fliers at malls  Johnson , a 43-year-old mother of four, shares her beliefs with most people she meets. She begins many conversations with creation naysayers by asking, " What do you know about evolution to be true ?" In  1995  she and her brother asked the  Shawnee Mission School District  to use Of Pandas and People, a science textbook that puts forth intelligent design _ the idea that an intelligent being created  Earth  and everything in it. District officials said they considered the text but rejected it. Johnson and her husband began visiting shopping malls on weekends to place homemade creationist fliers on cars. The fliers contained passages such as this : " The theory of evolution is just a theory, yet our public school's texts do not mention the significant amount of scientific evidence against it. Why the censorship ?" For  Johnson  and her husband,  Eric , 37, the truth about how the universe came to be is readily available and has been for centuries. " You have to believe the  Bible  is true," said  Eric Johnson , a stockbroker. " If it's not true, it's just a paperweight."  Celtie Johnson  said she was not completely against evolution being taught.
She said she just wanted teachers to feel comfortable presenting the pros and cons of  Charles Darwin 's theory. Many feel pressured to teach evolution as a fact, she said. She has been told, subtly and not, to sit down and shut up. She has not. " I feel confident that most humans have common sense, that they can critically think,"  Johnson  said. " I don't want them to be plagued with believing evolution, because it's not true."  brk : Macro vs. micro Some on the 10-member  Kansas Board of Education  agreed with  Johnson , and in  August  the board approved science standards that contained references to microevolution, or adaptation, but no mention of macroevolution, or change from one species to another. The revised version no longer lists evolution as one of science's unifying concepts. The revised standards also omit many references to the age of  Earth . There is no longer any mention of the big-bang theory _ the idea that the universe was born in an explosion of matter and radiation between 12 billion and 20 billion years ago. Those deletions are significant to " young Earth creationists" such as  Johnson  who believe that the  Earth  was created in six 24-hour days sometime in the last 7,000 years. Creationists say they have evidence that supports this belief :- It takes about 300 to 1,000 years to form an inch of topsoil, but the worldwide average depth is about 7 to 8 inches, which means the  Earth  is only a few thousand years old, creationists say. Evolutionists respond that that argument does not take erosion into account. - The eruption of  Mount St. Helens  in  1980  produced 25 feet of finely layered sediment and gouged canyons in one afternoon, which shows that millions of years are not required to form rock layers.
This lends credence to the global flood and other catastrophic events in the  Bible , creationists say. Evolutionists say erosion happens at variable rates all over the world. Catastrophes explain some geologic formations but not all. -  Earth 's magnetic field has been decaying rapidly, which creationists say points to an age younger than 10,000 years. Evolutionists counter that the decay is not steady and that much evidence exists for several reversals of the decay rate. Most creationists say that scientific theories must be observable. Although it is true that monkey blood and human blood are similar, that is not evidence the two species are related, said  Glen Kailer  of  Perry ,  Kan. , a researcher with the  Creation Science Association  for  Mid-America . Creationists view that similarity as more proof of design,  Kailer  said. " A  Chevy  and a  Ford  are not descended from a common ancestor,"  Kailer  said. Neither evolution nor creation can be tested or has been observed, but creationists say their theory has a witness : the  Bible . Evolutionists, on the other hand, believe that some science works in the comparative mode, said  Ed Wiley , a  University of Kansas  evolutionary biologist. Something that is true for one life form will be true for another. One particular point of contention is transitional life forms. Creationists say that scientists have not found any fossils of transitional animals and that no transitional animals exist today.
They do not believe that animals such as the archaeopteryx, a bird with reptile characteristics that some scientists think links birds and dinosaurs, are transitional. Indeed, the archaeopteryx is not a true intermediate form between birds and reptiles,  Wiley  said. But it had transitional characteristics between the two species, such as wings and reptilian attributes, he said.  Wiley  said creationists would not ever accept the archaeopteryx as a transitional animal, because it was too dangerous to their faith in a God so powerful he could create everything just as it is today. More specifically, believing that Michigan is older than described in the first chapter of Genesis threatens some creationists' understanding of the basis of their faith, said  Keith Miller , an evangelical Christian and a geologist at Air Force. Most Christians,  Miller  said, find no conflict with believing that God could have used evolution to create the universe. Biblical literalists can not accept that, he said. If the days in Genesis actually were millions or billions of years, dinosaurs would have lived and died long before humans. That would mean death and dying came long before  Adam  and Eve were cast out of the K.I. Sawyer AFB in what Christians know as the Fall of Man,  Miller  said. That is in direct conflict with a literal reading of the  Bible . " They view their interpretation of Scripture as being primary,"  Miller  said. " They don't accept the validity of nonbiblical sources of truth. Everything comes through a scriptural lens." For  Miller  and  Wiley , evolution is a fact of nature with many theories of how it works.

But for people such as Gregory C. Smith and Ham, evolution is a philosophical belief system just like creation. Ham said both groups agreed on observable facts such as natural selection and mutation. Those things are " what we observe in the present," Hartney said. " In trying to connect to the past, you have to use faith."  brk : ` Days in shock' Debruzzi and Phillips think many scientists overlook evolution's missing details, such as transitional fossils, and teach the scientific theory as proven fact to unsuspecting science students. Vallie said she spent decades believing that humans evolved from lower forms and that species could change into other species over millions of years. A former premedicine major, she faults a belief in evolution for leading her to make bad decisions as she struggled through more than one divorce and a life she saw as purposeless and random. " It's dog eat dog," McCarrick said. " That's what I was living. It was survival of the fittest." Then one day about five years ago she was talking to her brother, a mechanical engineer, and he brought up intelligent design. Kroeger said she did not have a clue as to what he was talking about. She knew only about evolution. But her brother told her there was overwhelming evidence against evolution.

Something clicked. Johnson began to research creation. Soon  Eric Johnson  joined in. They began to feel more and more duped by their science classes,  Celtie Johnson  said. " We spent days in shock," she said. When the shock wore off,  Johnson  said, she decided she had to spread the word. She joined the  Creation Science Association , seeking more information. It was  Johnson 's insistence that the  Kansas  science standards were flawed that drew together the band of writers who drafted the alternate standards, said  Kailer , one of the writers. Johnson's motivation was good science, he said. " Celtie is not at all alone," he said. " Celtie is one of the thousands who recognize the absurdity of evolution as science." But she is one of the few willing to speak out, said  Linda Highland  of  Olathe , who first met Johnson at a legislative forum some years back. Highland said the state board made the right decision in  August , and she credited  Johnson  for helping board members find the strength to take a stand. " I think that maybe she builds courage in others by showing that she isn't afraid to take this issue on,"  Highland  said.
  Johnson  said she was motivated by the search for truth. " I don't know what it is. Maybe some people have the ability to see the proof," she said. " I think the majority of people believe in evolution because they don't have the facts."
