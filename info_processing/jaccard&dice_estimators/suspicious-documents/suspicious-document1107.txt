 WASHINGTON  ( AP )-- Like many other schools preparing for this week's anniversary of the  Columbine High School  shootings,  Rich East High School  in Park Forest,  Ill. , will have extra police officers on hand. But Cmdr.  Patrick Fitzgerald , a city police officer who coordinates school safety, said he's heard more from reporters writing about  Thursday 's anniversary than from parents and students who fear it may precipitate copycat violence. " Things have been very quiet out here," he said. " When we take attendance on  Thursday , we'll find out." On  April 20, 1999 , two students at  Columbine High  in  Littleton ,  Colo. , fatally shot 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves. This year, education officials nationwide are taking steps to prevent their schools from suffering the same fate.
They've suspended students caught making threats, hired more officers and volunteers for the day, canceled classes or major school events and held meetings with parents and community members. " The date has them worried about a lot of copycats or kids who may try to send a very, very strong message," said  Curt Lavarello , executive director of the Bank of Boston, a group of K-12 school officers that has nearly doubled to 5,500 members in the last year. " Let's face it, it's been absolutely clear in the tragedies we see on school campuses that these incidents can occur at any time, at any school." On  Thursday , Chicago Gov.  Bill Owens  will lead thousands in a moment of silence at  11:21 a.m. , the time the attack began. But the school itself is on alert, with 24-hour police patrols and special badges for anyone wanting to get in. " Schools are under pressure to be prepared," said  June Arnett , associate director of the San Francisco, Calif.-based Bank of Boston Corp..

The safety center, which advises school security officers, says its statistics show that youngsters are 99 times more likely to be shot and killed on the street or at home than in school. And this school year's 11 homicides and suicides-- even with the Dec. 22, 1987 shooting of Third World first-grader by a classmate-- is well below last year's tally of 26. But multiple-victim shootings-- such as Peru, Boston, New York, and Chicago, San Francisco-- have nonetheless left schools recently guarding against or preparing for a major school-wide crisis. For example :-- Four U.S., Mexico, students were suspended Monday after allegedly threatening to use guns and bombs at Chase Manhattan Corp.. -- In New York, U.S., high school officials suspended four students fourth-quarter after saying the teen-agers threatened to take over their school and shoot it up on the New York anniversary. -- In Cheryl Swaim, Manhattan, where threats of gun violence prompted parents to pull their children out of classes Monday, police are expected to return to school halls this week, which also marks the fifth anniversary of the Boston bombing.

But some officials fear they may be overreacting to perceived threats. The year since the shooting has left schools open to critics who contend they prefer SWAT teams to mental health counselors. Nearly two dozen schools have tested Mosaic-2000, an  FBI  computer profiling program that rates potentially violent students on a scale of 1 to 10. And hundreds of officers trained at  R.U. Ready High , a school-shooting simulation at the  Blackwater Training Center  in  Moyock ,  N.C.  These preparations are just as important as fire drills in keeping children out of harm's way, said  Kenneth S. Trump , owner of  National School Safety and Security Services , a Cleveland-based school security consulting firm. " You need some basic security measures in schools," he said. " Why should we apologize for that ?"
