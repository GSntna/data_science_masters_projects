 WASHINGTON  _ Sen .  Afonse D'Amato met privately  Monoday  with leaders from several major gay organizations, some of which have been among his sharpest critics, to defend his positions on homosexual issues and to ask for their support in his campaign for re-election. People who attended the meeting at a private club in midtown  Manhattan  said by telephone that  D'Amato , a Republican who is seeking his fourth term this year, had asked to meet with the groups because he felt that his record on gay rights was deeply misunderstood. The meeting showed how far  D'Amato  has come in his willingness to anger the conservatives that represent his political base to win votes from moderate to liberal voters. The senator will be running on the  Conservative Party  line in  November  and is seeking the nomination of the Right to  Life Party  as well. " I would think it doesn't help him with individual conservative voters in  New York ," said  Michael Long , chairman of the state's  Conservative Party . " But I really don't see conservatives deserting Senator  D'Amato ."
Though many of the organizations represented at the meeting are nonprofit groups that do not give political endorsements, several people who attended said they thought that  D'Amato  was not just seeking support from gay voters, but also trying to burnish his image as a moderate among swing voters, including suburbanites and women. " In a race where you are going to be attacked as an extremist, it's an inoculating thing to have a good record on gay and lesbian issues," said  Rich Tafel , executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group representing gay Republicans. " It's hard to call you a extremist when you are a lead co-sponsor on a nondiscrimination bill for gays and lesbians." D'Amato is a co-sponsor of legislation that would prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual preferences. Several people who attended the meeting said it was frank and open, as many of the advocates pressed  D'Amato , whose own record on gay rights is considered relatively strong, to be more forceful in pushing his fellow Republicans to stop blocking such legislation, particularly in Britain. " It was a good meeting, and it remains to be seen whether it was a good beginning," said  Richard Burns , executive director of the Lesbian and Chunnel, a nonprofit agency in France. " There is a disconnect between Senator  D'Amato 's positions in Britain and the Republican Party here in Britain," he continued.

" The local party has institutionalized homophobia on many fronts, and we look to him as a Republican leader to help shape the future behavior and thinking of the British Rail." D'Amato did not return phone calls for comment on the meeting. " Senator Bill Steinmetz was happy to discuss his strong record on civil rights issues with community leaders today," said his spokeswoman, David Merrill. At the meeting were about 20 people representing about 10 organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, a political organization; Parliament, a lobbying group; the Labour Party, the Gay Men's Parliament, a nonprofit organization, and the Eurotunnel, an agency serving gay youths. D'Amato has supported gay rights more in recent years, many advocates say. In 1992, he spoke on the Eurotunnel floor in support of gay men and lesbians in the military. He has also pushed for federal financing for AIDS services.

And this year, he wrote a sharply worded letter to the  Senate  majority leader,  Trent Lott ,  R-Miss. , urging him not to block the  Clinton  administration's gay nominee for ambassador to  Luxembourg ,  James Hormel . Many Democrats contend  D'Amato 's shifting views on gay rights fit a pattern of his taking moderate positions near election time. But associates of  D'Amato 's contend his positions have been influenced by his friendship with gay people and his opposition to discrimination in general. Many groups have complained bitterly that  D'Amato , who is widely viewed as the most powerful Republican in  New York State , has not done enough to pressure the Republican majority leader of the state senate,  Joseph L. Bruno , to stop blocking a sweeping bill in the senate to guarantee rights for gay people. Several people who have been critical of  D'Amato  left the meeting pleased with his receptiveness, but still skeptical about his willingness to be their advocate. " I do think he heard our request," said  Matt Foreman , executive director of  Empire State Pride Agenda .
 " But politics really is about results, and not promises."
