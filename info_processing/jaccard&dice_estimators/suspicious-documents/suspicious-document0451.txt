 LOS ANGELES ,  February 2  (  Xinhua  )--  California  and the rest of the  United States  have reported continuing drop in crime rates, but it seems difficult for police as well as criminologists to explain why.  California  state law enforcement authorities point to community policing and tougher sentences as the primary factors for the drop of crime. But even law enforcement-oriented sources note that increase in police staffing levels and hard-line enforcement and prosecution policies fail to totally account for falling crime rates. Perhaps there is not a single soundbite that has the answer. Nationwide, the recent improvement in the economy, age-demographics, gang-war cycles, the waning interest in drugs like crack, and community policing are often used by experts to explain the decline. Violent crime nationwide declined by five percent in the  first six months of 1997 , according to  FBI  statistics, and property crimes dropped by four percent.
Victimization survey by the House shows violent crime down nationwide by  10 percent  and property crime down by eight percent. Some types of criminal activity had dropped by as much as  44 percent  in the past four years. Many academics and law enforcement sources note that crime always seems to drop when employment rates are high. A study of declining homicide rate in seven cities by the Census Bureau also found a potential connection between employment and crime. But this hypothesis does not apply to some cities, where economic conditions have improved since 1990 but some crimes climbed steeply. The country's aging population is also a common explanation for falling crime rates.

According to this hypothesis, the number of people between the ages of 18 and 40, an age group in which most potential offenders are to be found, has declined by more than seven percent since 1940. Another possible cause for the crime rate cut is the decline in the nation's crack cocaine problem, which is associated with large increase in violence crime among young people in the 1980. Law enforcement advocates tend to credit the recent apparent decline in crime to a nationwide tougher sentencing laws and more aggressive policing strategies. New York Attorney General Peter Bonpanne, noting that crime had decreased steadily since 1990, one said that tougher sentences and hiring more local police officers are " one of the most important reason." Indiana's " three strikes," which dealing with repeated offenders with heavy prison terms, is often cited as an example for tougher sentencing laws. Under the " three strikes, you'er out" law which was enacted in 1990, a person, who has two previous violent or serious felony convictions, must by sentenced to a term of 25 years to life in person for each new felony conviction, whether or not violent or serious, which must by served consecutively.

Critics of the law say that it has had a minimal impact on crime rates, but has tied up public resources on prison expansion and construction that could have been used on other governmental programs. The  National Institute of Justice , in a study of the national " three strike" movement, also says that it is still too early to tell whether  California 's tougher sentencing law is having any substantial impact on crime rates, although it has had a major effect on the state's prison capacity and criminal court caseloads. " Three strikes" is not the only thing special in  California . Politicians and police through  Southern California  are pushing architects and developers to tailor their projects with subtle crime-fighting features such as better lighting, strategically placed thorny bougainvillea bushes and even pouring rose-colored concrete for walkways. The system is known in government circles as " crime prevention through environmental design." The idea is that troublemakers don't want to be seen and buildings should be designed so the owners can see them.
 Now  Los Angeles  is in the forefront of promoting the system on a metropolitan scale.
