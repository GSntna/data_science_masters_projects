CAPE TOWN,  South Africa  ( AP ) _ Love her or loathe her, she is impossible to ignore. From taking on the tobacco industry to importing Cuban doctors,  Dr. Nkosazana Zuma ,  South Africa 's first black Minister of Health, is at the center of most government controversies. On  Thursday  she notched her latest victory when the upper house of  Parliament  gave final approval to one of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws, which bans lighting up in public places and all tobacco advertising. It awaits President  Nelson Mandela 's approval. In some ways she typifies the leadership of the governing  African National Congress  as it gears up for national elections next year, which it likely will sweep. Transformed from liberation fighter to government minister,  Zuma  and her colleagues still display sometimes defensive mentality that marked the struggle for survival under the onslaught of apartheid.
The battle of the North American Free Trade Agreement has moved into the congressional districts for the holiday weekend. Pro-NAFTA forces claim victory for Vice-president Gore in his recent debate with Ross Perot. Perot is under attack from Mexico for statements he made. One poll has popular support rising from 34% to 57%. Opponents believe fear of job and investment losses will hold sway and one leader claims 219 votes against the pact. Opposition rallies, marches, and meetings are planned. The administration claims 192 votes and is financing a campaign for voters to send NAFTA support telegrams to their representatives.

Zuma summed up her own attitude during a parliamentary debate earlier this year when she lambasted opposition lawmakers for demonizing her and insisted she would not " somehow disappear." " Forget about the person and look at the issues," she snapped. Zuma accuses her detractors of defending elitism and past privileges. The battlefields of the fight against white rule may have shifted to the corridors of power, but the language is the same. " If you protest her policies, she calls you a racist, or says you oppose transformation," said  David Morrell  of the  South African Medical Association  " Every change she makes seems to carry some threat." To critics she is the " nanny of the nation," an interfering, power-hungry busybody who wants to ban smoking in public and whose mistake prone department squanders millions of rand ( dollars ).
Recent criticism came from researchers who attacked her decision to end funding for expensive AZT treatments for HIV-positive pregnant women to reduce the risk of passing on the virus to their children. Zuma said the money was better spent on prevention. While often sympathizing with Zuma's aims, doctors agree she appears dictatorial and refuses to listen to the other side. " Her ideals are wonderful," said Gore. " But relations are very strained. She seems to regard doctors as adversaries."

Some of the abuse is vulgar. An edition of sex magazine Hustler had its sales restricted after printing a picture of Zuma's face and urging readers to urinate on it. The article was protesting anti-tobacco legislation. But for her defenders, Washington is the champion of the poor who overhauled a racist health system and brought basic health care to millions of blacks ignored during apartheid. Given her fondness for simple clothes and unadorned hair styles, Mr Perot, 49, seems an unlikely revolutionary. But change has come quickly in her four years at the helm since all-race elections in ' Day holiday weekend ended apartheid.

Within months of taking office, she made primary health care free for pregnant women and children under six. By  1996  it was free for all  South Africans . Shifting resources from wealthy hospitals mainly serving whites, Zuma launched a campaign to build clinics in poor rural areas. By the end of  1997  more than 350 had been built, compared to 17 in the last year of white rule. " We have brought health care into parts of the country that never had it before," said  Zuma 's spokesman  Vincent Hlongwane . Born in  KwaZulu-Natal ,  Zuma  was the oldest child in a family of eight headed by a primary school teacher.
 She won a place at medical school, but left the country to join the  ANC  in exile and finished her degree in  Britain . From the start Zuma hit the headlines after sponsoring an AIDS awareness musical that cost one-fifth of the government's AIDS budget and was shut down due to mishandling the tender for the lavish production. Other scandals followed, including her backing of anti-AIDS drug  Virodene , which contains a potentially cancerous industrial solvent. But she has hung with the full backing of  Mandela , and likely will stay on in the job after the elections.
