 WASHINGTON  _ Their names are  McGowan  and  Smith ,  Isaacs  and  Svendsen . They are Christian and Jewish, conservative and liberal. They were raised in  Boston  or  Texas  or  Los Angeles . This  weekend , for the first time in history, they gathered to celebrate their physical similarities, their common heritage, and their shared personal experiences. More than 400 of them, all born in  South Korea  and nearly all adopted by white parents in the  United States . " It's very powerful, very meaningful, very exciting," said  Anne Hai Ja Curtis , 32, who grew up in  Quincy ,  Mass. , and works for the  National Park Service  in  Brookline ,  Mass.  " I wanted to be here to feel what it is to be among my own... But I also wanted to be a part of history, to say that I am part of the generation that started all this."
" All this" is international adoption, a phenomenon that has helped to alter the way Americans perceive their country and the means by which they build their families. Almost half a century ago,  Korea  became the first nation from which  US  citizens began systematically to adopt children who were not only born abroad, but also looked unmistakably different from themselves. The three-day meeting in  Washington , which ends with a march to the Korean War monument  Sunday   morning , is the largest-scale effort ever to bring together adults adopted from another nation. As a result, for researchers and others concerned with the subject, it offers an opportunity to gain unique insights into adoption practices, biracial and multicultural issues, and the integration of untraditional families into the American social fabric. " For many of us working professionally in the field, it lets us examine what intercountry adoption has looked like and what it will look like for the years to come... And we can learn a great deal from that,"  Madelyn Freundlich , a leading expert on adoption in the  United States , said  Saturday . " This is an important way of finding out what we need to do to make adoption the best that it can be for the future."
While those attending recognized the broader significance of the " Gathering of the First Generation of Korean Adoptees," as it was called, their motives were anything but clinical. Nearly all of them grew up in white families, frequently as the only minorities in their schools or their communities. Moreover, race and ethnicity added layers of intensity and complexity to the already complicated issues of adoption that helped to shape their self-perceptions. The meeting this weekend represented the first opportunity most of these adults have had to feel what it's like to be in the majority. Even more pointedly, it gave them the chance to interact with an array of people who not only share their skin color, their facial structure, and their national origin, but also their sensibilities as adoptees. " It's something like an emotional rush to be with so many people I have so much in common with,"  Mark Leibowitz , 27, a retail store manager from  Briarcliff Manor ,  N.Y. , said  Saturday .
" A lot of people probably don't understand how big a deal that is, but that's because... it's normal for them. They're with people just like them all the time. We're not." The gathering's sponsors were a group called also-known-as, which is a national organization of Korean adoptees;  Holt International Children's Services , the Arkansas adoption agency that started Korean adoptions in the mid-1950s after the war there; the  Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute , a New York-based research center that  Freundlich  heads; and the Arkansas Society. The fact that the event took place at all, organizers said, demonstrated how far adoption has come in the last few decades _ metamorphosing from a secretive institution that was tainted by shame for generations, to a process that is increasingly open and even celebrated today. They said the addition of a racial component provided yet another dimension of significance for a country that is becoming increasingly multiethnic and multicultural.

" Intercountry adoption split wide open the notion of secrecy, because people couldn't pretend anymore that they couldn't see the differences between parents and their children," said Dr. Alfred Crowle, a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases vice president who in 1984 became one of the first Korean orphans to be adopted by Americans. " Now I think we're coming to realize that when you talk about the world in a global context, we are the ultimate global citizens." While the focus of the meeting was commonality, and the mood was decidedly upbeat and optimistic, there was no effort to gloss over the problems of either adoption or race. Nearly everyone interviewed said they had encountered racial bias, but insisted they were not scarred by it; similarly, some said they'd had negative adoption experiences, but the vast majority described their lives and adoptive parents in positive terms. Virtually everyone made a point that experts agree is indicative of an increasingly public attitude among adoptees of all types. The Korean-born adults said that, as they get older, they have more and more interest in their biological and ethnic roots _ along with a greater and greater desire to search for their birth parents, even if only to see them once.

Many participants, of all ages, said they were so fully immersed in their white worlds growing up that they perceived themselves as being just like the people they always saw. " It's like I was a Caucasian trapped in a Korean body," said  Kylee Harrington , 27, a marketing coordinator from  Oak Hill ,  Ill . The older adoptees, in particular, described being raised by parents who tried so hard to transform them into " full-fledged Americans" that they made them feel insecure or ashamed of the part of them that was Korean, and couldn't understand the alienation and discrimination they endured. " I love my parents dearly... but they didn't get that they were contributing to my becoming a wreck inside," said  Mi Ok Song Bruining , 38, an artist from  Cambridge .  Eileen Thompson-Isaacs , 44, a social worker in  Somerville , echoed those views and laid much of the blame on adoption agencies that, at the time, counseled prospective parents to put aside their children's pasts and assimilate them into  US  culture as thoroughly as possible. One of the radical turn-abouts in adoption  Sunday  is that adoptive parents are given the opposite advice : to embrace their children's background and incorporate it into their lives.
 Indeed, the younger the adoptees in  Washington   this weekend , the more likely they were to describe childhoods filled with education about  Korea ,  summer  camps that stressed ethnic pride, and homes in which the artwork and foods of their homeland were common. " I've gotten so much that I just didn't feel that there's a void or anything more I needed to complete myself," said  Sara Hurley , 26, who lives in  Bartlett ,  N.H. , and works for the  Appalachian Mountain Club . But she added that a few intense days with her fellow adoptees have had an effect : " I used to say I don't want to go back to  Korea . Now I'm not so sure."
