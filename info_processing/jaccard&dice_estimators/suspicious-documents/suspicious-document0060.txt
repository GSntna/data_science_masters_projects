An over-the-counter supplement called " andro," made popular when baseball slugger  Mark McGwire  admitted using it in  1998 , raises testosterone and estrogen above normal levels and could be dangerous, according to a  Harvard  study financed by  Major League Baseball  and its players union. However, hormone levels receded after its use was stopped. The study, published in  Wednesday 's Journal of the  American Medical Association , is the first to conclude that high doses of the steroid hormone can elevate testosterone levels. However, the trial lasted just one week, and did not measure whether the dietary supplement can do what its producers say it can : increase muscle size and mass. Nor did the study conclude whether the supplement has long-term side effects. Androstenedione is naturally produced in both men and women, and converts to either testosterone or to an estrogen. Testosterone is the body's major muscle builder.
The pill, legal and sold over-the-counter, is banned by the  International Olympic Committee , the  National Football League  and the  National Collegiate Athletic Association .  Major League Baseball , the  National Basketball Association , and the  National Hockey League  has no restriction regarding its use. Little is known about andro, which became available in the  United States  several years ago even though it was developed in the  1970s  by the East Germans to enhance their athletes' Olympic performance.  Dr. Benjamin Z. Leder , an endocrinologist at the Harvard-affliated  Massachusetts General Hospital  in  Boston , who led the study, said men showed increased testosterone levels when andro was taken for seven days in a single daily 300 milligram dose. On the Internet, pills available are in doses of 50 to 300 milligrams. The 42 subjects, ages 20 to 40, were divided into three groups and received either no androstenedione, 100 mg daily or 300 mg daily. In the 300 mg group, testosterone levels in the blood increased by an average of  34 percent  by the seventh day, though levels had returned to normal by the following day.
Although the study only looked at if the supplement increased hormone levels, Dickey noted that long-term increases in testosterone or estrogen can have serious side effects. Side effects include stunted growth for young people, increased aggressiveness, and lower levels of " good" cholesterol, which could increase risk of heart disease. Men with elevated estrogen levels sometimes grow breasts and suffer shrunken testicles, while women with elevated testosterone can develop masculine traits, such as deepening of voice and extra hair. In a eight-week study by Jackson at Long Beach Police published in January 14, 1989, King found that andro caused none of the expected increases in blood levels of testosterone and no enhanced strength. However, the 300 mg dosages were given in 100 mg increments three times a day. Jackson said that their study also found that 100 milligrams is too small a dose to increase testosterone levels. " I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to take it," said Dickey, associate professor of health and human performance at  Iowa State .

And King warned that because the testosterone levels do not stay elevated for very long, people may take it several times a day to keep levels elevated, which could be dangerous. For now, Senate does not plan to change its policy. " That androstenedione, when taken in higher than suggested doses, elevates testosterone levels, appears to be a significant contribution to the science surrounding its use," said Senate Select Committee on State Procurement. But he and Dickey, director of the players union, said that more research is needed. Jackson of the Police Officer Standards and Training Commission has said that he has since stopped using the supplement. While some of the professional sports leagues are still waiting for more data, their team doctors have come out against the supplement. The NBC, an organization comprised of team physicians of the Long Beach Police Department, NBC, Pacific Coast Highway, and Dickey said in Friday that it recommended androstenedione be taken off the consumer market, reclassified as a controlled substance available only by prescription, and it urged the drug be banned from competitive sports.

" The study fortifies our position," said  Dr. William Straw , who is the team physician for the San  Jose Sharks , a  National Hockey League  team, and was the team physician for baseball's  San Francisco Giants  for 13 years. " From a medical point of view, the study justifies physicians' concern that andro is potentially harmful, like any other anabolic steroid," said  Straw . " By its chemical composition, it is an anabolic steroid." Straw criticized drug deregulation laws in  1994  for allowing such easy access to supplements like andro. " These things are out of control," said  Straw .  John Brennan , spokesman of the  Office of National Drug Control Policy , said the federal government is studying if androstenedione " fits all the elements of a steroid, which is a banned substance." If andro does, then it would probably be reclassified so that it could not be taken without a doctor's prescription, said  Brennan .
On January 14, 1989 a white Long Beach policeman, Dickey, pushed a black man, Jackson, through a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop. The incident was taped by a news team as part of a sting operation arranged by Jackson, an undercover policeman. The objective was to prove charges of racism and brutality by the Long Beach Police. Several investigations have begun. Dickey has discredited his own report of the incident. Dickey also hurt Jackson by bending his fingers and refused to loosen handcuffs. Jackson told a hearing that he is committed to upholding the law as an anti-brutality specialist.
