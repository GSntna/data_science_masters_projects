   SALINAS ,  Calif.  _   Tom Jones  is a hands-on farmer, not some touchy-feely type with sentimental ideas about Mother Nature and her eternal wisdom. Yet  Jones  listens to his strawberry plants which, he asserts, change every day. You get in trouble when you interfere with their natural cycle and try to make the plants do what  you  want, he says. At the same time, the co-owner of  Windward Farming Co.  in  Salinas  explains that he loves strawberry growing because it is not a totally mechanized process but one that allows for much creativity. In his case, that creativity includes an increasing emphasis on organic farming. Fresno native  Jones , 37, came up through the farming ranks. At 16, he was picking melons in  Arizona .
After that he worked as a trucker and an irrigator, among other jobs, eventually ending up in the  Salinas Valley  strawberry fields in  1982 . " I got hooked on strawberries," he says with a laugh. He is also hooked on the valley with its ideal growing conditions created by rich soil and a relatively cool, moderate climate. Several years ago, he and two partners converted eight of their approximately 125 acres of strawberries to organic, and the results were everything they could have hoped for. The berries taste and look great, and there is increasing demand for them. Windward had been moving toward less reliance on chemicals for at least 10 years, reducing pesticide use by as much as  80 percent ,  Jones  says : " Then we started thinking, if we can control pests organically, why not go all the way ? ( Using fish emulsion and other non-chemical fertilizers )."
 Windward Farming  now has 22 acres of organic berries and more acreage in transition. It takes three years to convert from conventional to certified organic status, and therein lies a problem. Jones and partners, like many small- to medium-size agricultural enterprises in the area, lease their land, typically on a two-year basis. To go through the conversion process and make it worthwhile, " we really need six- to eight-years leases," he asserts. At the same time, he understands why such leases aren't offered. The land, for the most part, is not owned by large companies but by families with long ties to the area. The land is so valuable that they just can not tie it up in long-term leases, he admits.
At the same time, that value is a certain guarantee against encroaching development. " Last time farmland was for sale here," Jones reports somewhat incredulously, " it went for  $ 30,000  an acre." Jones' advocacy of organic methods is both philosophical and practical. So-called trap crops _ flowers, alfalfa _ planted alongside cash crops attract beneficial insects and simultaneously take care of such nasty critters as the lygus bug, a small insect that winters in the hills and comes down to the valley in  spring . The lygus injects a poisonous substance into the seeds on the skin of strawberries, causing the seeds to die and making for misshapen berries. However, given a flavor choice of strawberry or alfalfa, the lygus will go for alfalfa every time, leaving the berries unmolested and proving that organic methods not only make good sense on ecological grounds but are also cost-effective,  Jones  says. What's more, organically grown berries always win in taste tests, report employees of  Driscoll Strawberry Associates , the large shipper that contracts with  Jones  and many other growers.
(  Jones  also gets his patented plants from  Driscoll 's nurseries. ) While organic growing methods are still in their infancy nationwide and account for a relatively small percentage of fruit grown in the  Salinas Valley , the idea is catching on. For growers like  Jones , the popularity of organic produce means higher prices, which in turn means that field workers receive a better wage _ typically  $ 9.80  an hour rather than the  $ 9.35  working in conventionally cultivated fields _ guaranteeing their commitment to these environment-friendly methods. " Our people ( workers ) are the real key to our success," says  Jones , adding proudly that his company experiences a  95 percent  return rate among the roughly 150 workers employed during the  May-November  harvest season. During that time, 16-hour work days are common. Jones admits ruefully that at times he's so bushed that he forgets to bring home berries for his wife and three children for days on end. " But my wife (  Ruth Anne  ) knows how to improve my memory," he admits.
Sometimes when Farmer Jones looks in his refrigerator, he finds a couple of store-bought baskets _ grown by one of his competitors.     ( BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM )    TAKE A FEW SERVING TIPS FROM THE GROWER    Asked his favorite way to eat strawberries,  Tom Jones , who grows strawberries both by conventional and organic methods in the  Salinas Valley , has a quick answer : " Right in the field." The  Jones  family _  Tom , his wife,  Ruth Anne , and their three youngsters _ never tire of taking an evening stroll and nibbling fruit still warm from the day's sun. Twelve-year-old " Angie is the best picker," her father reports. The  Jones  family makes jam and  Ruth Anne  sometimes fixes a very adult treat : She injects berries with liqueur, then dips them in melted chocolate. They also sweeten sliced berries to taste with brown sugar and add a few drops of balsamic vinegar. After they macerate 10 minutes or so, spoon them over slices of pound cake dolloped with lightly sweetened whipped cream.
   ( END OPTIONAL TRIM )        GEORGEANNE'S KITCHEN : Lip-Smacking Ideas for Fresh Strawberries         By  Georgeanne Brennan     c.  1999  The  San Francisco Chronicle        SAN FRANCISCO _  Here are some ways to use the best of the local crop of fresh strawberries now in our markets.     Strawberry and Rhubarb Puff Pastry Tart .  Thaw frozen puff pastry. Slice about 6 rhubarb stalks into 1/2-inch-thick slices and cook them in enough water to cover, along with some brown sugar, a little lemon juice and a split vanilla bean, until they are soft but still hold their shape. Drain and chill, reserving the juice. When chilled, mix the rhubarb with 2 cups strawberries ( halved if large, whole if small ). Add about 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup brown sugar; mix well.
Roll out the pastry and put it on a baking sheet. Heap the fruit mixture in the center; then fold pastry up around the fruit, leaving an open space about 4 inches in diameter. Dot this with butter and bake in a 375 oven about 30 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden. While the tart is cooking, reduce the reserved juices to just a few tablespoons. To serve, dust the tart with powdered sugar, cut into wedges and drizzle with the reserved juice.    Fresh Strawberry Ice Cream.  Wash and hull 2 pints of strawberries; then mash them together with 1/2 cup sugar and let them stand for an hour.
Combine 2 cups heavy whipping cream and 2 cups milk in a saucepan; add 3/4 cup sugar and a split vanilla bean. Cook and stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves but the mixture is not boiling. Whisk together 4 to 5 egg yolks in a bowl; then whisk in about 1 cup of the hot milk mixture. Slowly pour this into the saucepan. Continue to whisk until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Do not boil. Remove the vanilla bean and stir in the mashed strawberries.
Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.    Strawberry-Chocolate Shortcake . Hull and thinly slice strawberries. Stir in a little sugar, and refrigerate at least an hour and up to 8. Make a favorite shortcake recipe. Cut the warm shortcakes in half. Top each half with strawberries.

Melt semisweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over warm ( not boiling ) water. Drizzle chocolate over the shortcakes; then top with dollops of lightly sweetened whipped cream.    Boise Interagency Fire Center.  In a trifle or other footed glass bowl, make a solid layer of 1/2-inch-thick slices of pound cake or ladyfingers. Drizzle with a little kirsch. Top with a 1/2-inch-thick layer of softened strawberry ice cream, then add a scattering of sliced strawberries. Repeat the layers twice more.

Cover the top with whipped cream; then decorate with clusters of sliced strawberries and a dusting of toasted almonds.    Strawberries in Red Wine with Rosemary.  Hull strawberries, leaving small ones whole and cutting larger ones in half. Cover with a light red wine, such as a Beaujolais, and add a little sugar and about 1/4 teaspoon minced rosemary. Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Spoon into bowls, adding some of the juices, and serve with cookies for dipping.
