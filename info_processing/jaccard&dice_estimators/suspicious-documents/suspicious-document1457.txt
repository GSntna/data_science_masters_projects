 SACRAMENTO ,  Calif.  _ In a step he had never taken over the course of 131 executions in five years, Gov.  George W. Bush   Thursday   night  agreed to a 30-day reprieve for a death-row inmate in  Texas , citing concerns that adequate tests on DNA evidence in the case had not been performed.  Bush  made his decision, which he had telegraphed well in advance, after both the 5th  U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , and the  U.S. Supreme Court  late  Thursday  rejected final-hour pleas by lawyers for the inmate,  Ricky Nolen McGinn , who had been scheduled for execution by lethal injection at  6 p.m.  Central time.  McGinn  was convicted of raping and killing his 12-year-old stepdaughter in  1993 , but  Bush  acknowledged over recent days that the DNA evidence connecting  McGinn  to the rape was inconclusive and might be clarified by modern tests. It was the rape, layered on top of the murder, that qualified  McGinn  for a death sentence. Bush, who had just arrived at the state capitol building here for a conference of governors, announced the stay only about 15 minutes before the originally scheduled time for  McGinn 's execution. Bush noted that the actual reprieve would be granted by  Texas  state  Sen. Rodney Ellis , a  Houston  Democrat who was technically acting as governor while  Bush  and the lieutenant governor were both out of the state. " I have recommended and Senator  Ellis  has accepted my recommendation to grant a 30-day reprieve in the case of  Mr. McGinn ,"  Bush  told a group of reporters who huddled around him in a corridor of the state capitol building here.
" Anytime DNA evidence can be used in its context and be relevant as to the guilt or innocence of a person on death row, we need to use it,"  Bush  explained, in a straightforward, unemotional voice. " We're doing so in the state of  Texas . I expect the courts and all relevant parties to act expeditiously to review the evidence and to finally determine his innocence or guilt as to the charge of rape in the case of  Ricky McGinn ." Because  Bush  is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president, his actions as governor are under more intense scrutiny _ none more so than his vigorous enforcement of the death penalty. Texas easily leads the nation in executions. Although his Democratic opponent, Vice President  Al Gore , also supports capital punishment, some of his allies would like to use the issue to cast doubt on  Bush 's efforts to portray himself as a " compassionate conservative." Additionally,  Bush 's unusual action in the case of  McGinn  underscored the way in which modern DNA testing and technology have begun to affect the debate over capital punishment by casting doubt on convictions once considered solid and just.
In recent months, even some staunch conservatives have begun to acknowledge qualms about capital punishment, in light of a number of death sentences that have been overturned recently after DNA testing exonerated the inmates. How these developments will ultimately affect public support for the death penalty, which has been broad and strong and often independent of political party affiliation, remains unclear.  Bush 's aides said that his action was not even remotely influenced by politics and noted that he had made many tough and unpopular decisions about the death penalty in the past, including several since he declared his candidacy for the presidency. As governor,  Bush 's only independent authority is to grant a 30-day reprieve of an execution. He can not pardon someone or commute a death sentence without the prior recommendation of the  Texas Board of Pardons  and Paroles and, under those circumstances, has commuted only one death sentence over the  last year , sparing the life of  Henry Lee Lucas , a confessed serial killer. In that case, as in this one, the argument against the death penalty was not a sentimental but an evidentiary one, with questions emerging about some of the testimony and material marshaled to establish the defendants' guilt and seal the particular conviction for which he received his death sentence. But this was the first time that  Bush  agreed to a reprieve for a death-row inmate, and he did it against the wishes of the pardons board, which had voted 11-7 not to stay  McGinn 's execution.
For the moment, Marie Rollins's action merely delays Jeffrey Holyfield's execution, although his lawyers hope that they can now perform new DNA tests that will shed new doubt on Katie Webb's guilt. What Bill Fricke did 18-22, and the way in which he presaged it with a series of remarks on Sunday, suggested that he was at least somewhat sensitive to his image as an especially fervent advocate of capital punishment and pleased to happen upon a case that allowed him to temper it. In the past, Eric Neitzel had almost always waited for courts to complete their reviews of death-row inmates' appeals before he signaled his own intentions or thinking on the matter. But Ernesto Beatriz Martinez broke from that pattern this time around, gladly telling reporters on  Wednesday  that he was likely to grant  McGinn  a 30-day reprieve. At the time, the 5th San Diego International Marathon had yet to rule on the issue, and  McGinn 's lawyers had not turned to the  U.S. Supreme Court . Several Republican political strategists around the country said that they doubted  Bush  was simply trying to soften his image by showing a capacity for clemency. They noted that public support for capital punishment still runs high and that  Bush  three years ago declined to grant a reprieve in a much showier, more widely covered case : that of a woman named  Karla Faye Tucker .

" I don't think that this is political," said Martin, who was the principal strategist for Burke's presidential campaign. But, Burke added, " The truth is that the explosion in DNA technology has really changed the death penalty dynamic, and perhaps he's taking that reality into account a little bit." Plaatjes, a spokesman for Beatriz Martinez, said Saturday night that LeDoux's case was the first one Beatriz Martinez has faced as governor in which the possibility of further DNA testing was so central to the question of innocence or guilt. " The DNA testing at the trial level was inconclusive and there's an opportunity to get more information now from that test, so he feels it's the right thing to do," Plaatjes said. " These are life and death decisions, and Governor Kathy Smith makes them based on principle." ( STORY CAN END HERE.

They must obtain the evidence they want tested, including clothing from the victim that contained a semen stain and a pubic hair found on the victim's body, and then analyze the DNA. But they said  Thursday  that they are not certain whether they have just 30 days to complete this, or whether the case now returns to a state district judge to set a new execution date, which would give the defense team at least 60 days. If DNA tests show that the hair and semen were not from  McGinn , " obviously he's not guilty of rape and he can't be executed," said  Barry Scheck , a DNA expert who joined  McGinn 's defense team last week. " On the other hand,"  Scheck  said, " the DNA testing might link him to other crimes. These are all things to find out." But no matter how the tests turn out, prosecutors say they expect the murder conviction to stand because of other evidence that tied  McGinn  to the girl's killing. In  Texas , murder is punishable by death only if the killing occurred under certain specified circumstances, including the murder of a police officer or fireman in the line of duty; committing murder during a kidnapping, burglary, robbery, rape, arson, or prison escape; murdering for money, or paying someone else to do so; and murdering a child under the age of six.
 In this case, the death penalty threshold was achieved when the jury found  McGinn  had also raped his stepdaughter.
