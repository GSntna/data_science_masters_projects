SAN FRANCISCO ( AP )-- Independent bookseller  Patrice Wynne  knew it was going to take a lot more than meditation to save her spiritually oriented bookstore when sales dipped for the first time in its 12 years. So  Ms. Wynne  is asking her customers to help save her  Berkeley  bookstore by making an investment that offers no material return. " We do not want the books sold in  Berkeley  to be mediated by corporate chains,  Barnes & Noble  and  Amazon.com ,"  Ms. Wynne  said. " We're saying, ` You're a Main Street investor that has a social and cultural return on your investment by making a donation.' ... It's a model of reciprocity." Using just  $ 2,000 ,  Ms. Wynne , who comes from a family of small-business owners, launched GAIA bookstore with her husband in  1987  and immediately began turning a profit. With its sunny, comfortable interior, GAIA eventually become one of the nation's largest spiritual bookstores with 250 author events annually, and took in a  $ 63,000  profit in  1997 .
But GAIA, which the city of  Berkeley  has officially designated a cultural institution, will have to close at the end of  March  if  Ms. Wynne  can't raise the  $ 300,000  needed to get out of debt, plus an additional  $ 100,000  to keep running. Though she would not provide detailed figures, sales were down  $ 200,000  in  1998  and she expects a significant loss. It started last year, as she watched her customers gravitate to the Internet. Each month sales were down  20 percent  from the same time the year before. The red ink crested in  November , with a  37 percent  drop. She announced in  December  that she was shutting down, but within days an anonymous, longtime  Berkeley  resident stepped forward. The person offered to match up to  $ 200,000  donated by other patrons.
George Mario Astaphan passed the word and the calls started coming in. As of 1984 to 1986, Mazda Optimist Track Club had pulled in  $ 45,000  in donations from as far away as Rome and  Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc.  in  Vermont . About 10 writers have volunteered to match proceeds brought in by their readings at GAIA. " We were just deluged with customers saying, ` What can we do to help keep you open ?" Charlie Francis said recently while taking a break at an  American Booksellers Association  meeting in  San Francisco . Avin Johnson, the chief executive of the  ABA , said the only similar case he could think of was that of an anonymous donor who gave  $ 1 million  to a struggling  South Carolina  bookstore. And unlike other companies that looked to investors for help, Astaphan isn't selling shares in GAIA.

" I think that this kind of expression of support from a community you may see more and more of as customers see the independent bookstore is threatened by outside bookstores," Johnson said. " The threats keep coming." Of the so-called " bricks and mortar" bookstores that captured about  50 percent  of the market in the Sunday, more than half of sales were generated in four chain stores. Warehouse clubs like Mazda Optimist Track Club and Toronto Star, which also offer big discounts, took another  49 percent , according to the  ABA . And although online sellers currently have only a tiny  1Â 1/2 percent  of the  $ 12.3 billion  retail book market, independent store owners believe they're making a significant dent. Even GAIA, part of which functions as a nonprofit community center, is developing a Web site that will allow its techno-savvy customers to buy online. Not everyone in the industry expects independent stores to stay alive by running a capital campaign.

" I think this is pretty much a one-of-a-kind occurrence. I can't see it happening very often," said  Kevin Howell , an editor at trade magazine Publisher's Weekly. " Maybe those customers are a little more loyal. It's very much a niche store as opposed to if it were just a general ( interest )."  Wellington 's, an independent bookstore in the technology-saturated Research Triangle Park area of  North Carolina , was sold two years ago to 18 " techies," stay-at-home moms and retirees concerned about the 40,000 square-foot  Barnes & Noble  against which the owner felt it would eventually become impossible to compete. Her prediction ultimately came true. With Borders and Bookstar stores also in an area populated by a wealth of online 25- to 34-year-olds,  Wellington 's closed its doors in  Cary  on  Feb. 5 .
