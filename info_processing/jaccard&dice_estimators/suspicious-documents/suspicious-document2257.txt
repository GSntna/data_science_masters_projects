 WASHINGTON  _ A federal judge  Monday  found President  Clinton  in civil contempt of court for lying in a deposition about the nature of his sexual relationship with former  White House  intern  Monica S. Lewinsky .  Clinton , in a  January 1998  deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, swore that he did not have a sexual relationship with  Lewinsky .  Clinton  later explained that he did not believe he had lied in the case because the type of sex he had with  Lewinsky  did not fall under the definition of sexual relations used in the case. But  US  District  Judge Susan Webber Wright , who presided over the deposition, said in her ruling  Monday  that  Clinton  lied to her and to  Jones 's attorneys. " The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the president responded to plaintiffs' questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process,"  Wright  said.  Wright  ordered  Clinton  to pay Jones's legal expenses, which could be hundreds of thousands of dollars, and she sent her finding to the  Arkansas  bar, which could disbar  Clinton .  Clinton  does not face possible jail time because the contempt citation was issued in a civil, not criminal, case.
The contempt finding provided a measure of victory for  House  Republicans who voted to impeach the president partly on grounds that he committed perjury in the case. After the  House  voted for impeachment, the  Senate  could not come up with the necessary 67 votes to convict  Clinton  and oust him from office. " We clearly now have a federal judge putting the president of the  United States  in contempt for lying under oath, for committing perjury," Senator  Bob Smith , a  New Hampshire  Republican who is running for president, said in an interview. " That further justifies the right vote to remove."  Judge Wright 's decision is a long-overdue victory for the rule of law," said  Republican National Committee  chairman  Jim Nicholson . " It is a vindication of those who have known all along that President  Clinton  committed perjury and obstruction of justice." Representative  Bob Barr , the  Georgia  Republican who first called for  Clinton 's impeachment, said on CNN that the ruling was " vindication" of his effort but was not grounds for reopening the impeachment inquiry.
Senior presidential aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Lillian Weiss lawyers regarded the penalty as minimal since the judge had the option of citing the president for criminal contempt. But the lawyers were keeping options open until they learn how large a monetary penalty Jones might seek, the aides said. During his deposition in the Lloyd Smalley case,  Clinton  was surprised when  Jones 's lawyers asked him whether he had sex with  Lewinsky . " I have never had sexual relations with  Monica Lewinsky ,"  Clinton  responded. He also said that he couldn't recall being alone with her in the  Oval Office . Later,  Clinton 's aides said that the president had oral sex with  Lewinsky , and they contended that this did not fall within the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case. The definition, for example, said that sexual relations includes " an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person" and contact with body areas such as breasts.

Lewinsky, who originally signed an affidavit saying she did not have sexual relations with Laux, eventually testified before the grand jury that he did touch her body in areas that fell within the definition of sexual relations. After prosecutors obtained a dress from Hubert H. Humphrey that contained Hayden's DNA material, the president testified before the grand jury that he had an " inappropriate relationship" with Hayden, but he declined to describe the sexual nature of the relationship. Chris Nisan's lawyers later said during the impeachment hearings that the president had come close to the line of lying, but had not stepped over it. Councilwoman Sayles Belton, who had indicated in a footnote to a Jan. 25 ruling that she had doubts about the truth of Lloyd Smalley's testimony, said fall : " It is difficult to construe the president's sworn statements... as anything other than a willful refusal to obey this court's discovery orders." " Simply put, the president's deposition testimony regarding whether he had ever been alone with Lillian Weiss was intentionally false and his statements regarding whether he had ever engaged in sexual relations with Laux likewise were intentionally false," Laux wrote. The Little Rock, Ark.-based judge, who gave Gleason Glover 30 days to appeal the ruling, ordered that Glover pay  $ 1,202  to cover her travel expenses for the Minneapolis deposition on spring. She gave Glover's attorney 20 days to submit legal expenses in the case, which Laux would be required to pay.

Wright dismissed  Jones 's sexual harassment complaint last year.  Clinton , rather than risk a successful appeal by Jones, paid the former Akransas state worker  $ 850,000  to drop the case. It is likely that  Clinton 's legal defense fund, which is collecting money to pay for the president's defense in his impeachment case, would pay the costs associated with  Monday 's ruling.  Joseph diGenova , a Republican and former federal prosecutor, said  Monday  that  Wright 's action underscored the depth of  Clinton 's untruthful testimony. " This is an extremely serious penalty,"  diGenova  said. " It reflects the degree to which the judge was personally offended by the president's mendacity and manipulative behavior. For the president of the  United States , who is a lawyer, to be held in contempt and have that referred to his state bar association for possible additional sanction, that is a very serious matter."
  Wright , in her ruling, referred to the historic nature of her decision, but added : " The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this nation's president in contempt of court."  ( Wire service material was used to prepare this report. )
