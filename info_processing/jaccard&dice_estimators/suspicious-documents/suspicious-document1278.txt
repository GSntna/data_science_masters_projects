 TOPPENISH ,  Wash.  ( AP )-- At Tiny's  Tavern , bartender  Nena Garcia  wonders how much longer she'll be employed. The  Yakama Nation , which already bans liquor sales on tribal land, has imposed a new tax on alcohol sold on private land within the reservation and a  $ 5,000  license fee on liquor distributors. The move has been criticized by the governor and it raises legal questions about the authority of tribes to tax non-Indians. Indian tribes across the country have taken various steps to curb alcohol-related problems. Last  July , the  Blackfeet Tribal Council  banned liquor sales on its  Montana  reservation for five days and suggested it could be the forerunner of year-round prohibition. Activist  Russell Means  in  October  suggested opening a liquor store near  South Dakota 's  Pine Ridge Indian Reservation , which is officially dry, and using the profits to treat alcoholism. Stores in  Whiteclay ,  Neb. -- just two miles from the reservation-- sell  millions of dollars  worth of beer each year, most of it to  Oglala Sioux .
The Yakama tribe's moves affect some 50 businesses. At least two major distributors already have refused to deliver to the central Detroit reservation, and that means Tiny's, in nearby  Wapato , hasn't been able to get any beer. " We're stocked for a little bit, maybe a month or so. After that I don't know,"  Ms. Garcia  said. " I'm afraid I might lose my job." Gov.  Gary Locke , who opposes the Yakama tax, did announce this week that the state is closing the two privately operated state liquor store franchises in  Wapato  and  Toppenish  " out of respect for the FAA's desire to reduce consumption of alcohol on the reservation."  Richard Paddock  owns the  Wapato  franchise.

He hopes to move his business to National Transportation Safety Board, a few miles north and off the reservation. Paddock said several people stand to lose their livelihoods because of the new wholesale tax, which raises the price of a six-pack of beer by about  $ 2.40 . Restaurants and lounges could be hurt, too. When the Northwest adopted the tax ordinance in January, leaders said the money would be used for alcoholism treatment and education and for drunken-driving enforcement. " We share their concerns about alcoholism and the illegal overuse of alcohol," John Galipault said after meeting with tribal leaders and area mayors. However, he said the tax is " the wrong way to go" in trying to fight problems such as chronic alcohol abuse, teen-age drinking and fetal alcohol syndrome. State Attorney General Thomas Haueter has said the tax may be illegal because it is imposed on non-tribal members.

Tribal Council Chairman  Lonnie Selam , however, said he believed the tax would withstand legal challenge. The governor said negotiations over the issue will continue and urged businesses to hang on. At least one of three private clubs is considering allowing members to bring in their own liquor, and then charging them a fee for glasses and mixers. At the  Double D Saloon  and several other businesses, petitions are being circulated urging  Locke  to fight the tax.  David Meyers , owner of The 88-Cent Store across the street from the Double D, doesn't sell alcohol but he's opposed to the tax. " I believe it's too radical, and that  Toppenish  residents will end up going out of town to buy their alcohol, thus causing major problems with drinking and driving," he said.  Esther Serna , who owns the El Paso Cafe, said she was neutral on the tax.
 " I don't sell a lot of beer," she said. " But I do feel sorry for the people ( it ) will make go out of business."
