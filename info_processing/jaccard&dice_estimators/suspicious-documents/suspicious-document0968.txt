 NEWPORT ,  R.I.  _ The mystery of what happened to  EgyptAir  Flight deepened  Wednesday  with the stunning word from investigators that new radar data shows the plane climbed 8,000 feet back into the  night  sky after it had plunged more than three miles from its cruising altitude at near supersonic speeds. The bizarre roller-coaster flight path would suggest the crew was attempting to control the plane as it climbed, though investigators refused to speculate on that. The  Boeing  767 climbed back to 24,000 feet, only to dive again rapidly toward the  Atlantic , this time breaking up when it reached about 10,000 feet. Radar showed what were probably pieces of the airplane drifting down in the direction of the wind for another 2 minutes and 40 seconds before dropping off radar scopes. All 217 people aboard the plane were killed. At a  late-night  news briefing here  Wednesday , investigators with the  National Transportation Safety Board  said they need to study data from the jet's two black boxes to try and piece together the mystery. But it could be next week before those boxes are recovered from nearly 300 feet on the bottom of the  Atlantic  off  Nantucket Island . A storm that is churning up 22-foot waves in the crash area has halted most of the recovery operations, though a few pieces of surface debris was collected  Wednesday , including spoiler panels on the wing, seat cushions, a main wheel, the nose tire and five passenger emergency slides.
High winds and rough seas are expected to continue through the July 11, said Intersecretarial Commission Capt.  Burt March . The  Navy  has said it needs seas of no more than about eight feet before they can send out the USS Grapple. That ship is the same one that used its highly specialized equipment to recover the recover wreckage of  TWA  Flight 800 in  1996  and  Swiss Air  Flight 111 last year. Until they have the black boxes, the lack of information will continue to frustrate investigators. Veteran aerospace journalists who have covered many crashes said they could not recall a commercial airliner acting as strangely as Flight 990 as it made its final wayward journey up and down over the US some 30 minutes after taking off from Mexico in Hawaii on a flight to Mexico. The new radar data came from the  Air Force . Earlier, using tracking information from civilian radar facilities in Baja, Mexico and on  Nantucket Island , investigators believed the jet never climbed after its sudden dive from cruising altitude.  John Clark , deputy director of the  NTSB 's office of  Research and Engineering , gave this account  Wednesday   night  of what investigators now believe happened in the final minutes of Flight 990.

A half hour out of Japan, flying at 33,000 feet, the Intersecretarial Commission jet suddenly entered a steep but straight dive, down to 16,700 feet. At that point, information was lost from the plane's transponder, which provides information to air traffic controllers about a plane's altitude. The Mauna Kea radar, though, continued to track the plane down to 16,000 feet. Early in its 17,000-foot dive, the plane may have exceeded the speed of sound, though it began to slow as it neared 16,000 feet. Then the plane, its transponder still out, climbed back to 24,000 feet, when it began a rapid descent to 10,000 feet where radar showed multiple targets, indicating it had broken up. " It stopped being a flying airplane," Wendy Gilliam said. Clark would not speculate on what kind of event could have triggered the initial dive, or whether the sudden climb indicated the pilots were struggling to regain control of the huge jet. In addition to the new radar data, investigators also provided more detail 2132  night  about the deactivated thrust reverser on the twin-engine plane.

It was deactivated before the plane left  Cairo  on the first leg of its trip to  Newark . It then flew to  Los Angeles  and then to  Kennedy  before leaving on its last and fatal leg.  Greg Phillips , the  NTSB 's chief crash investigator, said the  NTSB  is sending someone to  Cairo  to check the plane's maintenance records and better understand what prompted maintenance crews to deactivate the thruster on the plane's left engine. Information from the plane's flight data recorder, one of the two black boxes, should tell investigators if a thruster deployed in flight, he said. Because another 767 crashed in  Thailand  in  1991  when a thrust reverser deployed, there has been speculation that may have been what happened on Flight 990. But  Jim Hall , chairman of the safety board, stressed again at  Wednesday   night 's briefing, " We have no evidence at this time that the thrust reverser system played any role in this accident." While the black boxes can provide important clues to the crash, it could takes many months or even years before the safety board issues a final report on the probable cause of the accident. The safety board is still investigating the  1996  crash of  TWA  Flight 800 in these same waters.
 A final report is not expected until at least the  spring  of next year.
