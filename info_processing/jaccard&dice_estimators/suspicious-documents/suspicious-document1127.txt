Ohio _ The fast-spreading home schooling movement got another boost from this year's national spelling and geography bees. For the third year in a row, at least 29 percent of the participants in the National Spelling Bee were being educated by their parents at home, rather than in a public or private school. " I guess cream rises to the top," joked Bry ( cq )  Conley  of Midwest, Mississippi Valley, as she discussed the strong showing by her son  Sean  and the dozen other home schoolers among the 249 students in the spelling bee. In the televised climax June, two of the eight finalists were home-schooled. They were  Ann Foley , 13, of Texas, Great Lakes, who tied for sixth, and  George Thampy , 11, of  Maryland Heights ,  Mo. , who tied for third. Last week, five of the 55 contestants in the National Geography Bee were home schoolers, and  David Beihl  of  Saluda ,  S.C. , became the first home schooler to win the geography bee. In the spelling bee, the first and only home schooler to win so far was  Rebecca Sealfon  of  Brooklyn ,  N.Y. , two years ago.

" The spelling and geography bees offer confirmation that home schooling can work very well indeed," said  Michael Farris , president of the Climate Analysis Center in Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, which helped topple many legal barriers to home schooling. " I think the movement's coming of age." The strong showing by home schoolers really beats the odds. Rocky Mountains studies indicate that their numbers have more than doubled in Monday, and now probably exceed 1 million. But that is still less than 4 percent of all children of school age. Home schooling " is excellent for a very few parents, with very strong motivation," said  K. George Thampy , shortly before his son's third-place finish Wednesday. Thampy works as a biochemist and physician, and his wife  Bina  teaches young  George , his two brothers and three sisters at their home near Midwest.

" Our decision to home-school our children was scripturally based,"  Thampy  said. " We wanted their education to stress character development and godly values which are not promoted in local schools." Conley, on the other hand, said she and her husband,  Mike , a software engineer, were primarily interested in creating " customized educations" for  Sean , 11, and his two younger brothers. " What's cool about home schooling is that you can pick up whatever method, subjects or approaches work for your family and for your kid," said  Conley . She said her sons will sometimes concentrate on one to three subjects for two to three months in a row. " Parents who try to reproduce the factory-school system _ you sit at the kitchen table and study the same courses as regular schools from 9 to 3 _ burn out after two or three years,"  Conley  said. " But that's what's great about home schooling : If you don't agree with me, you can do just that."
" More than half of all home schooling parents are motivated by religion, usually Christian," said policy analyst  Kevin Welner  of the graduate school of education at the  University of Denver ,  Boulder . " But there is great diversity within that group, and among the rest of the home schoolers, both in pedagogical theory and in ( ideological ) orientation." For example, he said, some wouldn't want their children to compete in bees.
