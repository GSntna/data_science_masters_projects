NEW YORK ( AP )-- The  FBI  on  Friday  tried to track the author of a file-destroying computer virus that has hit some of the nation's biggest corporations and infected tens of thousands of machines. Software companies posted new virus-killing programs on their Web sites to attack the Worm. Explore. Zip virus, which enters machines in almost the same way as the recent Melissa virus-- by disguising itself as a friendly piece of e-mail. Melissa infected hundreds of thousands of computers, but there were signs  Friday  that the new virus may not be spreading as quickly. Still, it hit systems at leading technology companies such as  Compaq Computer  and  Motorola  and other major companies, including  AT&T ,  Boeing  and  General Electric . The  FBI  would not reveal the methods of its investigation or provide a more specific estimate of how many computers were infected.
" This program is deleting files, and for people who did not have back-ups, they could be lost for good," said  Mark Zajicek , member of the  Computer Emergency Response Team  at  Carnegie Mellon University  in  Pittsburgh . First detected in  Israel  early this week, Worm. Explore. Zip masquerades as a message from a friend or acquaintance : " Hi ( Recipient Name ) ! I received your e-mail and I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at the attached zipped docs." The message is harmless unless the recipient opens an attached file.
That unleashes a program that can wipe out the contents of documents, spreadsheets, graphic presentations and other important files created by  Microsoft  programs. It also contaminates a computer's e-mail program and sends a copy of itself as a reply to any incoming e-mail. That is particularly threatening for companies where workers regularly zip e-mails back and forth. " Once the virus has started within an organization, it embeds itself into the system," said  Jan Kaminski , president of  FastLane Technologies , a Canadian software company. " There's nothing you can do until you actually remove some files from the machine." But, thanks to the run-ins with the  Melissa  and Chernobyl viruses earlier this  spring , computer systems managers reacted more quickly when word of Worm. Explore.
Zip began to spread. " We continue to get direct reports, but they're not increasing at the rate it might have, so we're encouraged by that," said  Zajicek . Zajicek warned, however, that computer users still need to be cautious about any e-mail with an attachment. " It's too early to tell how far it's already spread and difficult to tell how far it will spread in the coming days and weeks," he said. The United Airlines issued a warning on its Web site. " Users should exercise caution when reading their e-mail for the next few days and bring unusual messages to the attention of their system administrator," said  Michael A. Vatis , director of the United's United. " The transmission of a virus can be a criminal matter, and the United is investigating."

Worm. Explore. Zip is the third major bug to sweep across the Internet since late 1974, when the Melissa virus overwhelmed systems with floods of e-mail. A more damaging virus named Chernobyl struck in 1983, but did most of its harm overseas. The new bug is only known to attack computers using FAA operating systems Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. Rival operating systems such as United Boeing and Unix apparently are not vulnerable. Early warnings helped United, Northwest Airlines and United Airlines contain the damage 1979 when their computer systems were infected, while United said it shut down its corporate e-mail system for two hours as a precaution.

At  Boeing , the company shut down an e-mail system that links 160,000 computers. " We're hopeful we got things shut down fast enough so it will minimize the loss of any documents," said spokesman  Dave Suffia . At  Lucent Technologies , which makes telecommunications equipment, strange messages began appearing on computers on  Thursday   morning , said spokesman  John Skalko , who inadvertently activated Worm. Explore. Zip on his computer. " That was enough. I lost all my (  Microsoft  Word ) files," said  Skalko , estimating that 150 documents were destroyed.
At least 20 to 30 other computers were stricken by the virus before  Lucent  technicians shut down the e-mail system and inoculated it. " I think we nipped it in the bud," said  Skalko . Because of the way it works, Worm. Explore. Zip actually does not fit the technical definition of a computer virus. Instead, software experts said, the bug should be classified as a " Trojan Horse"-- a name borrowed from an ancient battle in which Greek soldiers hid inside a wooden horse to launch a surprise attack on the city of Troy.
