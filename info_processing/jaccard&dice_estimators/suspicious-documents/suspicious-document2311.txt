DAYTON,  Ohio  _  General Motors Corp.  and the  United Auto Workers  on  Tuesday  reached tentative agreements that could end two paralyzing strikes in  Michigan  and prevent two  Dayton  brake factories from being sold or closed before  2000 . The  Flint  strikes have crippled the world's largest automaker for 54 days, idling 200,000 workers nationwide and nearly half of  GM 's Dayton-area work force of 20,000. About 9,200 strikers at the two  Flint  parts plants will vote on the proposed agreements today,  UAW  officials said. If they approve a settlement, the  Flint  workers could begin returning to their jobs late tonight. Analysts believe local workers idled by the strikes could return to other area  GM  plants in  Dayton ,  Kettering ,  Moraine  and  Vandalia  early next week. The comprehensive settlement that includes the plants in  Flint ,  Dayton  and  Indianapolis  means  GM  will likely not face more crippling strikes this  summer .
 GM  officials were pushing for a comprehensive deal throughout the negotiations. Ratified settlements in  Flint  would end  GM 's longest walkout since  1970 . The dispute forced  GM  to shut down 27 of 29 North American assembly plants and cost the automaker close to  $ 3 billion , analysts said. " I hope in the future that the  UAW  and  GM  can sit down and find a different way of doing things, as we do with other automakers," said  UAW  president  Stephen Yokich . In  Dayton ,  GM  pledged not to sell or close two troubled  Delphi  brake plants, which employ 3,400 workers, until at least  January 2000 , said sources close to the  Dayton  plants. In return,  UAW  Local 696 agreed not to organize a strike against the automaker during the same time period.
The  International UAW  will seek to extend the no-close-or-sale pledge in national contract talks, and in return, possibly agree to a four-year contract instead of the usual three-year deal. But a source familiar with the  Dayton  agreement said  GM  was unable to eliminate a quota clause that requires workers to produce a certain number of parts in an 8-hour workday. Workers sometimes complete the work in five or six hours, but get paid for a full shift. Because of the quota clause, the brake plants have the lowest productivity rating among any of  GM 's parts plants, company officials said. " The agreement in  Dayton  secures jobs until  2000 ," said  Gary Hill , president of Local 696. " The plant ( on  Wisconsin Boulevard  ) has been here for 59 years and I'd like to see it around for another 59 years."
The  Dayton  dispute was the last obstacle to a comprehensive settlement on  Tuesday , said union officials in  Flint .  UAW  Vice President  Richard Shoemaker  and  GM  officials in  Dayton  said the agreement includes " a framework" to improve the competitiveness of the brake plants. " Now we must begin working together with the union and all of our employees to address the significant competitive challenges that these plants continue to face," said  Gerald T. Meier , director of operations for the brake plants. Despite the local agreement, the brake plants still face a gloomy long-term future unless the union and company can overcome massive financial losses. The plants, located on  Needmore Road  and  Wisconsin Boulevard , have lost more than  $ 40 million  in the past two years. " I don't see any change from general trends that affect the  U.S.  auto industry, said  Steve Dandaneau , a labor expert at the  University of Dayton .
" It remains a bleak outlook for auto workers and the union, and a strong one for the company."  Dandaneau  said the strikes didn't solve the core problems facing the union. " It displaces the same conflicts into the future," he said. " If anything, it wore down the workers a bit. It strengthened the resolve of Wall Street and (  GM  ) executives to take drastic action in the future." Assuming ratification in  Flint ,  GM 's attention will turn to catching up on production of 600,000 cars and trucks canceled by the strike-related parts shortage.
Analysts said  GM  probably will be able to make up only about two-thirds of the shortfall, or about 400,000 units. It will take about a week or two to get all the assembly plants producing again, said  Mike Robinet , an auto industry consultant with  CSM Corp.  in  Farmington Hills ,  Michigan . The company said  last month  it expects  July  sales to fall as much as  40 percent  below the year-earlier period as dealers face short supplies of some models."  GM  will have a killer  1999 , since they've got to make up production lost during the strike," said  Nicholas Lobaccaro , an automotive analyst with  Merrill Lynch & Co . Lobaccaro estimates the strikes will cost  GM   $ 3 billion  in lost profit by the time production gets up to speed. That includes  $ 1.2 billion  in lost  second-quarter  profit the company has already accounted for.
Assembly plants in the  U.S. ,  Canada  and  Mexico  could resume production within 10 days and begin months of heavy overtime to fill back orders. More than 15,000 idled workers at  GM  suppliers also could return to work soon. While details weren't released of the pacts in  Flint , some elements of the agreement emerged from company and union officials. The  UAW  pledged to boost productivity and  GM  said it would invest in the  Flint  Metal Center, where 3,400 workers have been on strike. The plant makes truck hoods, fenders and metal cradles that attach engines to frames.  GM  also pledged not to sell the other  Flint  plant that is on strike.
The dispute was in its 54th day, the longest walkout against the automaker since a 67-day national  UAW  walkout in  1970 . The  Flint  strikes, however, are more costly, and solidify the central  Michigan  city's place in  GM  labor lore. It was in  Flint  in  1937  that sit-down strikes first led  GM  to recognize the  UAW . The  Flint Metal Center  strike began  June 5  and was followed by the  Delphi East  walkout  June 11 . The disputes centered on the  UAW 's effort to preserve jobs and  GM 's effort to shed them to match its shrinking market share and catch more efficient rivals. Negotiations intensified  Saturday  as  GM  and the union concluded a four-day binding arbitration hearing with umpire  Thomas Roberts .
The arbitrator hadn't said when he would rule, but negotiators said both sides were worried about losing. Hahn Air Base had sought the arbitration, alleging that the walkouts were illegal because they concerned national issues such as plant investments. The 60th Military Airlift Squadron maintained the strikes were allowable under the contract because they concerned health and safety issues. A break came  Saturday , when Rhein-Mein Air Base agreed to return metal-stamping tools to the 433rd Military Airlift Wing. Workers cheered  Sunday  as the trucks entered the factory. Kelly AFB had removed the dies over  Memorial Day weekend , two weeks before the first strike, in an effort to keep its redesigned Chevrolet and  GM  pickups on track for  fall .

The dies are used to form truck body panels. The removal infuriated the Landstuhl Army, which said it violated the 60th Military Airlift Squadron contract and provoked the strike. Talks to resolve the U.S. strikes languished for weeks as costs mounted for Travis Air Force Base and idled thousands of workers who missed paychecks and depended on unemployment benefits. Strikers receive about $148 million in weekly strike benefits. Rhein-Mein Air Base members in the Frankfurt make about  $ 800  a week, excluding overtime. Most of the Dayton-area workers idled by the U.S. trikes are represented by the Defense Ministry and received about  95 percent  of their wages and benefits during the shut down.

But about 1,000  UAW  members at the  Dayton  brake plants will find out in about two weeks whether they will receive unemployment for the work they missed. A hearing was held  Tuesday  in  Columbus  by the  Ohio Bureau of Employment Services  to determine if the strike-related layoffs are due to a labor dispute or a lack of work as the result of a parts shortage, said  OBES  spokesman  David Garick . If the state finds a parts shortage triggered layoffs, the local workers could be eligible for checks in about two weeks at the earliest,  Garick  said.
