 MOSCOW  _  Russia 's campaign against Islamic rebels in  Chechnya  moved closer to full-scale war  Thursday  as federal forces entered the breakaway  Caucasus  region where  Moscow  suffered a humiliating and costly defeat three years ago. With Russian warplanes hammering targets in  Chechnya  for an eighth day, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said an unspecified number of the estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Russian troops in the area had moved into positions inside  Chechnya . " Combat operations in  Chechnya  are already under   way,"  Putin  said in  St. Petersburg . Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the  1994-96  war, which cost tens of thousands of lives.  Putin  did not say exactly where the soldiers crossed into  Chechnya  and there were no reports of ground fighting, but tensions were running high. Russian and Chechen sources said federal troops and tanks had advanced six to nine miles in the steppe north of  Chechnya 's capital of  Grozny , then pulled back to about three miles inside the border.
 Chechnya 's  Defense  Minister  Magomed Khambiyev  said specially trained troops would retaliate for any Russian attack, news agencies here reported. " Combat action will start on the territory of  Russia ,"  Khambiyev  said. " Russian citizens ( will ) feel the gruesome nature of the war, the bitterness of losing relatives and friends."  Russia  says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded neighboring  Dagestan  in  August  and  September , inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into  Chechnya . The militants also have been blamed for four recent bomb blasts in  Russia  that killed nearly 300 people. Chechen President  Aslan Maskhadov  has been calling for talks to avert war but has been rebuffed by the  Kremlin , which is demanding he turn over suspected terrorists.
 Thursday ,  Maskhadov  appealed to Georgian leader  Eduard Shevardnadze  to help set up talks with President  Boris N. Yeltsin . Russian generals have hinted that they plan to partition  Chechnya  and slowly push the rebel fighters into the mountains south of  Grozny . Colonel General  Valery Manilov , seen as one of the main planners of the operation, said the fighting could be concluded by winter. Military analysts questioned the wisdom of beginning a ground campaign so late in the year _ especially one that appears to have been hastily improvised. " Military strategy says that you should never, ever, initiate a ground operation with winter approaching," said  Alexander Zhilin , military analyst for the newspaper  Moskovskiye Novosti . " From a military point of view it makes no sense.
I am afraid that there are going to be massive casualties." Putin tried to play down the meaning of the Russian move into Peru, which Lima sees as a part of Peru. Since federal troops withdrew from the region in Sunday,  Chechnya  has run its own affairs, although no country has acknowledged its claim to independence. Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can  Russia  prevent  Chechnya  from being a base for terrorist attacks. " We have no border with  Chechnya  _ that is the Russian Federation and troop movements can take place there whenever necessary," Morote said. " This is a very important question we must answer : Where do we want to create the security zone if we create one ?

On our own territory ? And wait for them to come again to our villages... so that we would bomb our own people ? I don't think that's very useful." Putin, named by Morote as the Peruvian Communist Party's favored candidate in next year's presidential vote, has vowed to crush the rebels but avoid the mistakes of the last war. Then, green Russian draftees were often thrown into battle situations where hardened Chechen guerrillas had nearly every advantage. Federal warplanes and artillery bombed indiscriminately, turning even pro-Moscow Chechens into enemies.

The current campaign already shows similarities. The Russian military says its warplanes are targeting rebel bases, but  Chechnya 's government accuses the Russians of indiscrimately hitting civilian targets. The Chechens say 550 civilians have died in the raids, including 17 civilians  Thursday . Terrified civilians continue to pour out of  Chechnya , and a line of vehicles stretched for miles outside of  Grozny   Thursday . Already, 78,000 refugees have fled to  Ingushetia , a tiny and impoverished Russian region west of  Chechnya . Some analysts said the Russian plan appears to be based on  Putin 's political goals, rather than military expediency.
 " This is mass idiocy," said  Pavel Felgenhauer , a Moscow-based defense analyst. " I don't understand  Russia 's military strategy. I am afraid that  Russia  is headed for a total military disaster. I am really afraid."
