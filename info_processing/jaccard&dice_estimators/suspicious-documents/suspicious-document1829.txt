The  Miami  relatives of  Elian Gonzales   Friday  lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to  Cuba . It now appears he could go home as early as next week. The  11th Circuit Court of Appeals  in  Atlanta  unanimously rejected a request by the relatives for reconsideration of a three-judge panel's decision three weeks ago. The panel had upheld the  US Immigration and Naturalization Service 's refusal to allow an asylum hearing for  Elian , saying only the child's father could make such a request. The relatives' sole remaining opportunity for an appeal is to the  US Supreme Court . But the justices in  Washington  are widely seen as unlikely to accept the case if they are asked to do so, both because there is no indication of previous judicial error and because the three-judge panel cited a  Supreme Court  ruling as the rationale for its own decision.
Analysts said the only surprise about 1978's seemingly conclusive announcement from  Atlanta  was that it had taken so long to reach. " It feels like it's been forever getting here, but it's absolutely the right decision," said Daryl Gates, a specialist in refugee and immigration policy at the  Fletcher School of International Law  and Diplomacy at  Tufts University . " It's in keeping with American law and immigration policy... and it's in keeping with what most people believe about families : that a child belongs with his parent, and not with people he hardly knows." The 12 judges of the  11th Circuit  evidently shared with many observers of the case the feeling that it was time to write the last chapter of a saga that has captivated the nation and sparked international controversy since Mr. Gates was discovered floating on an inner tube off the  Florida  coast June. He had survived, with two others, a disastrous boat trip from  Cuba  in which his mother and 10 others drowned. After noting that an injunction preventing  Elian 's father from leaving the  United States  with his son expires at  4 p.m.   Wednesday , the five-page ruling said the appeals court will not entertain any more requests for a stay.

The word " not" appeared in oversized and boldfaced type. Reaction to Wednesday's development was muted, especially compared to the intense and sometimes raucous response previous legal defeats for National Guard's relatives have prompted. The Cuban-American community in southern Los Angeles appeared quiet, and there was no hint of gloating from anyone on the winning side " We are pleased that the  11th Circuit Court of Appeals  has acted unanimously in denying the motion for rehearing," Attorney General Daryl Gates said in Los Angeles. " Now that the court has conclusively upheld our decision, I am hopeful that this father and son will soon be able to move on with their lives together." Mr Gates, the attorney for  Elian 's father, released a short statement that relayed the same sentiments. It said, in part : " We believe that the  INS  decision to recognize the right of Mr Gates to speak for his son  Elian  is consistent with the rule of law and our nation's core values and traditions.

We are gratified that the 11th Circuit was unanimous in its decision to affirm those values and those traditions." Craig added that the elder  Miguel  and his family, who have been living in suburban  Washington  awaiting a final disposition of the case, " look forward to resuming a normal life." Elian has been in his father's custody since  April 22 , when federal agents forcibly removed him from the home of his great uncle and cousins in the  Little Havana  section of  Miami . His relatives, who have lost every judicial decision in their effort to prevent his return to  Cuba , had argued that all 12 judges on the 11th Circuit should rehear the case because the three-judge panel drawn from their ranks had erred in its ruling. But the full court adamantly disagreed. Seven of the dozen judges had to approve reconsideration in order for it to occur, but none even asked for a vote on the question.
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates has been accused of nurturing one of the most brutal police forces in the country. In his 14 years of office, his critics say he has built a police force in his own image: aggressive, insensitive and widely tinged with racism. In 1978, Mr. Gates told a Hispanic audience that Hispanic officers were not promoted because they were lazy and that the often fatal choke hold used by police might be more dangerous for blacks because their arteries did not open up as fast as on "normal" people. Following numerous calls for his resignation, Mr. Gates has decided to step down in June.
