MONTREAL _ With popular support for  Quebec 's independence in remission, Prime Minister  Jean Chretien  of  Canada  made a bold gamble with his country's future last week, introducing legislation that lays out  Canada 's first road map for national division, but one so littered with obstacles that he bets the separatists will never follow it. The new legislation, which requires a " clear majority" voting on a " clear question" on secession, is the direct outgrowth of what many Canadians now call their nation's " near death experience," the  1995  Quebec referendum that unity forces won by a margin of just  1 percent . Since that high point for separation, polls in  Quebec  indicated this  fall  that support for independence receded to a 10-year low, around  40 percent . At the same time, popular support for the separatists' provincial government, headed by Premier  Lucien Bouchard , fell to the lowest point in its five-year history, around  37 percent . In a new poll commissioned by Actualite magazine,  74 percent  of  Quebec  residents interviewed predicted that their province would remain in  Canada  " forever." Giving unity a nudge,  Bill Clinton  and  Jacques Chirac , leaders of the two foreign countries that the people of  Quebec  most care about, the  United States  and  France , came to  Quebec  this  fall  and pointedly praised  Canada 's federal system of government. Public opinion in  Quebec  is known to be volatile, as allies reminded  Chretien  when he prepared his " clarity" legislation in recent weeks.
The veteran prime minister, who entered politics when  John F. Kennedy  was in the  White House , said he knew best."  Canada  is my business, sir,"  Chretien , a  Quebec  native, snapped at a reporter who asked him about stirring up the separatists. " And it is the future of  Canada  that is at stake." While the bill introduced by the 65-year-old prime minister might seem innocuous to many Americans, it provoked what one columnist described as " World War II headlines." The bill, intended to carry out a  Supreme Court  decision from last year, authorizes the  House of Commons  in  Ottawa  to rule on the clarity of any secessionist question adopted by a provincial legislature. It also allows  Canada 's lower house to decide whether the referendum results constituted a " clear majority." Such seemingly inoffensive language immediately provoked a string of retorts from Parti Quebecois leaders, including " brutal," " Soviet-style," and an old standby : " straitjacket."
On one level, Quebecers of many political stripes believe that it is entirely up to their provincial legislature to set the rules for a referendum that would decide the political future of  Quebec ,  Canada 's largest province. Across political lines, the people of  Quebec  are galled by the idea that legislators from as far away as the Yukon would have veto power over the future of  Canada 's oldest European society. In a reflection of broad  Quebec  opposition to " outside interference," criticism has come from the local leader of  Chretien's Liberal Party ,  Jean Charest , a provincial legislator who leads in public opinion polls in the race to become  Quebec 's next premier. Quebec Liberals and Parti Quebecois legislators may adopt a common front against the bill. But, below the surface, separatists deeply fear being locked into a clear referendum question. In the two secession referendums, the proposal was deliberately phrased in ambiguous terms. Vague phrases like " sovereignty," " partnership" and " association" were used to draw under one tent people known as " soft secessionists" interested in the kind of autonomy now enjoyed by  Scotland  and hard-liners who want to create an independent French-speaking republic on the northern border of  New England .
In focus groups, support for breaking away from Canada plummeted when questioners used words like " secession" and " independence." Indeed, polls of Quebecers who voted yes to " sovereignty" in Saturday indicated that about one-third believed that they would still be able to keep their Canadian passports and to send members of Parliament to Canada. But last year, Ben Johnson, who was Canada's premier in  1995 , revealed that he had harbored other plans. He wrote in his memoirs that he had typed up a unilateral declaration of independence and that he had won from the French government a commitment to recognize an independent  Quebec  and to exert diplomatic pressure on other French-speaking nations to follow suit. Such revelations stiffened Johnson's resolve to establish clear rules of the game. " They ask a crooked question," the prime minister told reporters. " Fine.

So what ? There will be no negotiations." The " Clarity Act" also underlines the need for negotiations over a series of issues that secessionists generally prefer to leave fuzzy, particularly the problem of English-speaking areas' seceding from any newly independent Canada. Before a province could say goodbye to United States, it would have to negotiate with Canada and the other nine provinces its share of New York's 80 cents debt, its borders and its plans to guarantee the rights of Indians and linguistic minorities. If the results of the 1972 vote were used as a map, an independent Canada would lose most of its border areas with the Canada and Toronto, heavily English-speaking areas that voted no.. In addition, it would lose the top half of the province as Canada's Indian and Inuit inhabitants overwhelmingly oppose breaking ties with Soviet Union. ( STORY CAN END HERE.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) nn The stage may now be set for a major flare-up of secessionist sentiment. Last  weekend , leaders of  Quebec 's powerful labor and student movements appealed on provincial television for a " mobilization" of the old sovereignty coalition. Chretien's new bill " is hateful, a spitting in the face of democracy,"  Marc Laviolette , president of the  Confederation of National Trade Unions , said in remarks repeated over and over again on television. " The best way to defend the interest of the province's workers would be to have our own country." But the labor leaders were the same ones who, two months ago, nearly called a provincewide strike against the austerity program of the secessionist  Bouchard  government. Contributing to general dissatisfaction with  Quebec 's government, in the last six months there have been a strike by nurses and official audits showing that the government wasted  millions of dollars  trying to run a day care program, a manpower training program and a buyout of provincial employees. And  Chretien  introduced his bill at a time that was hardly propitious for street demonstrations : students are dispersing for Christmas vacations and workers are visibly obsessed with the shopping countdown to the holiday.
 " People just don't care," lamented  Michel Venne , a columnist for a separatist newspaper here, Le Devoir. Noting that polls this  fall  indicated that  70 percent  of Quebecers did not want another referendum, he said : " It is going to be difficult to mobilize people."
