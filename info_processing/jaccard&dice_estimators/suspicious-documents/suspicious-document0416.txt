SPARTA,  Ga.  _ By 10 o'clock on a typical  summer 's morning,  Hancock County  is almost deserted. A few children play in overgrown backyards full of junk cars and rotting timbers, and older people fan themselves on sagging porches. But almost anyone who works has left the county hours before, because there are virtually no jobs in  Hancock . The term " pocket of poverty" can not begin to describe the overwhelming stillness of a county with no economy : the deserted roads and store aisles, the fertile old cotton fields untilled and overgrown. Every employer of any size has left, and new ones seeking cheap land look at the county's statistics _ more than half the adults did not finish high school, seven of ten births are to unwed mothers _ and say no thanks. Unspoken in most of those decisions is the knowledge that  Hancock 's population is  82 percent  black, the highest percentage in  Georgia  and the fourth highest in the nation. Most of  Georgia  is prospering now, and the state's unemployment descended to a record low of  4.1 percent   last month .
But only 80 miles from  Atlanta 's economic turbine, the jobless rate was  10.7 percent  in  Hancock County , and its per capita income of  $ 15,390  is a third less than the rest of the state. The county's leaders have begged for projects no one else wanted : poultry processing plants, a landfill, a waste incinerator. Everything has fallen through except for the prison the state agreed to build a few years ago outside of this crumbling county seat, cut off from the county's 9,134 residents by empty miles and a haze of razor wire. So it was probably inevitable, given how money is spent in the South these days, that  Hancock County  would place its hopes for an economic future on the ultimate last resort _ an Indian gambling casino. For the last six weeks, ever since the tiny  Kialegee  Indian tribe in  Oklahoma  expressed an interest in coming, county residents have talked of nothing else. " It's the last chance for our county," said  Lesley James Roberts ,  Hancock 's special projects director, who is spending almost all his time on the casino project. " Think about what all those tourists could do for us.
We'd have the money to restore all those antebellum homes on the old plantations, and the storefronts in town and maybe do historical re-enactments. It would give our people a chance to become independent." The casino is a long way from becoming a reality. Among other hurdles, the state and the tribe would have to negotiate a compact for a reservation, and Gov.  Roy E. Barnes  has said he was opposed to casino gambling, although the state runs a lottery. ( The federal government could approve the project if the state refuses. ) But in the meantime, an instant bond has been formed between two groups of impoverished people, each of whom is relying on the other to achieve a dream of prosperity. The Kialegees, numbering about 450, are a landless tribe, sharing space in Tennessee, Utah, with the much larger Custer National Forest, to whom they are related.

Along with several other Utah tribes, they trace their origin to northern and central Montana, from which they were forcibly resettled 160 years ago along the Hiawatha National Forest. The tribe has tried several times to build casinos elsewhere but has been rebuffed, most recently in Wyoming, Wyoming, on the Michigan border west of Hudson Valley. New York Department of Environmental Conservation residents, close enough to California to benefit from its boom, said they feared crime and disruption from the casino, but the reception has been very different in Yosemite National Park. Most residents here are descendants of slaves who once worked the plantations in the area, and Ray Wood is one of a string of largely black counties stretching from Utah to Montana known as the Black Belt. Most of those counties are significantly more impoverished than their neighbors, even in a time of national bounty. In June 19, after Mary Hale, the editor and publisher of the weekly Pat Kaunert, noticed an article about California Department of Forestry's rejection, he suggested to northwest Wyoming officials that they contact the tribe. Kialegee leaders were immediately interested, and received a warm reception at an overflowing town meeting here last week.

They were even more intrigued when they learned that there are several large Indian mounds in  Hancock County , of unknown origin and dating back hundreds of years. " There was an almost instant camaraderie between the tribal members and the citizens of the county," said  Kenneth R. Baldwin , who runs an investment group in  McAlester ,  Okla. , that is representing the Kialegees. " They both have an understanding of what it means to have to struggle, to not have the opportunities you'd like to have. The tribe felt more welcome there than anywhere else they have been." Residents of the county have heard all of society's warnings about gambling, and are aware that it is not always a pathway out of distress. But they have also seen marketing studies showing that there is no other full-fledged casino in  Georgia ,  Florida  or the  Carolinas , and are convinced gamblers will make their way to this nearly abandoned county once the lights flash on the proposed casino, hotel and golf course. Considering  Hancock 's current situation _ in which the largest employer is its public school system _ the county's leaders say they could hardly do worse.
 " This is a place where people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and clothes on their backs,"  Roberts  said. " Our history hasn't put us in a position to be very selective about what we want."
