Gottschalt recalled that in  1981 , when she was 15, she left the swimming school and returned home to hear friends and family remark about how the little girl had developed into a muscle-bound woman with a deep voice. Other problems ensued : liver ailments, a hardening of back muscles. In  1984  she gave birth to a son with a clubfoot. Gottschalt believes her baby's deformity was a result of her being given drugs. As years passed and her anger grew, she wondered exactly what the little blue pills had contained. " I didn't think anyone cared enough about what happened to me to take any interest," she said.
" I gave up thinking anything might happen." Hope was restored last year when  Gottschalt  received a call from  Michael Lehner , a German lawyer who specializes in doping-related lawsuits. Lehner brought the criminal case against  Kipke , and with the public prosecutor helped try it. Lehner represented  Gottschalt  in this trial, along with eight other female swimmers who, he said, also had children with birth defects. Having read files kept by the swimming federation,  Lehner  learned that  Gottschalt  was a member of the B group of swimmers, young hopefuls who, according to the  Stasi  files, were to receive " supporting means" to improve their performance. " Supporting means" was code for the drug Oral-Turinabol, an anabolic steroid manufactured in  East Germany .
Lehner embarked on a search for other former swimmers who had also been administered the little blue pills and who would be willing to testify. Court cases involving doping to that point had involved only swimmers from programs in the former  East Berlin . Lehner widened the scope and found former members of teams in  Magdeburg ,  Erfurt ,  Potsdam ,  Chemnitz ,  Halle ,  Rostock ,  Leipzig  and  Dresden  who had been similarly doped. Lehner spoke to  Ute Krause , also a product of the  Magdeburg  program, and found that her experiences were nearly identical to  Gottschalt 's. After  Krause  left the swimming school in  1981 , her voice was deeper, she had liver problems and she battled depression. Years later, as the administrator of a nursing home in  Magdeburg ,  Krause  learned more about Oral-Turinabol.
Certain patients were being prescribed the drug to help regain muscle loss because of illness. In a medical textbook, she read of the link between anabolic steroids and chronic depression. She made no additional efforts to find out more about what had happened to her until  Lehner  called. " I suppressed what happened to me for so long,"  Krause  said recently in  Magdeburg . " I am still searching for my biography." In early  January ,  Gottschalt , 34,  Krause , 37, and three other former East German swimmers were present in a  Berlin  courtroom for the trial of  Lothar Kipke .
During his testimony,  Kipke  admitted that he had distributed anabolic steroids to the swimmers but contended that he was unaware that the drugs carried any adverse side effects other than a deepening of the voice. According to  Kipke , as research increased in the  1980s , he began administering the steroids in lower dosages and only in pill form. Ten feet from  Kipke ,  Gottschalt  listened to the doctor rationalize his actions. When she heard his lawyer explain that  Kipke  had only been following orders,  Gottschalt  exclaimed, " Say that to my son's face !"  Daniel , her 14-year-old disabled son, sat beside her. Krause seized the chance to address  Kipke  directly near the end of the trial.
" He avoided making a direct apology," Ben Johnson said. Clare Rodney called Johnson a " monster." " What gives a doctor that right to treat young girls like guinea pigs ?"  Lehner  said. At the end of the one-day trial,  Judge Peter Faust  ruled that  Kipke  had acted with " willful malevolence" in overseeing doping of the swimmers during his tenure as head doctor. Faust gave  Kipke  a 15-month suspended jail sentence, the most severe doping-related punishment meted out to a former East German official.

The verdict provided little solace for Johnson, who had hoped that the link between doping and birth defects would be addressed at the trial. Faust declined Clare Rodney's motion that the women whose children had birth defects receive financial compensation. " We are going to pursue this further," Johnson said. " I am representing nine clients who gave birth to children with birth defects." A member of the New York program, Carol Anne Letheren, who won a gold medal on the East German freestyle relay team in the Saturday Olympics, has given birth to two children with clubfeet, according to Ben. She has been unwilling to testify at the doping trials, however, because of her marriage to Juan Antonio Samaranch, a former swimming coach in Kennedy International Airport.

Since the  Kipke  trial,  Lehner  has learned that a former swimmer in  Leipzig  has a 19-year-old daughter with a clubfoot. In the next trial, for which no date has been set,  Lehner  plans to refer again to evidence yielded by the  Stasi  files, which show that East German doctors ordered female athletes to take birth control or have abortions because they feared Oral-Turinabol could damage fetuses.  Kipke , 72, is the 26th East German sports official to be convicted on charges of doping. They were involved in swimming as well as other sports. In  May , several months before the statute of limitations runs out on the prosecution of middle-level East German criminals,  Manfred Ewald  and  Manfred Hoeppner  will have their day in court.  Hoeppner , head doctor of the East German sports medicine service, oversaw an unofficial group that the prosecution contends was the committee for all doping programs.
 Ewald , former president of the  East German Athletics Association , wrote a book chronicling his control over East German sports.  Gottschalt  said she would be in the courtroom once again. And to current swimmers caught up in the latest controversy over the use of dietary supplements like creatine to improve performance,  Gottschalt  offers her own sobering advice. " Just leave it," she said. " It's not worth it. Let your body perform on its own."
