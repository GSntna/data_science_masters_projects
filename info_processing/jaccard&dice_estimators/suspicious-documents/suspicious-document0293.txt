 NEW YORK  _ Doctors are accustomed to offices crowded with patients, but in the last several weeks, salespeople from  Merck  and  Monsanto  have also been vying to get their attention to promote new arthritis drugs.  Monsanto  is off to a fast start with Celebrex, its arthritis tablet, which has had the strongest debut ever for a drug. The company anticipates more than 2.5 million sales calls on doctors this year, the most ever in a drug's first year, says  Monsanto . But  Merck  is gaining fast with Vioxx in its first couple of months on the market. And it will soon begin a big advertising push to compete with  Monsanto 's. These efforts are destined to make the pills as ubiquitous on the airwaves at least as Tylenol and Excedrin. Can celebrity endorsers be far behind ?
There is plenty riding on this battle. Analysts expect the market for prescription arthritis drugs to swell from  $ 7.2 billion  worldwide this year to  $ 13 billion  by  2005 . And for their own reasons,  Merck  and  Monsanto  want not just a success but a blockbuster. The scrap is beginning to get interesting. Even though Celebrex, which is being co-marketed by  Monsanto  and  Pfizer , controls the market, Vioxx has made steady gains since its introduction in  May . Celebrex and Vioxx are both Cox-2 inhibitors, prescribed as replacements for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and generally regarded as easier on the stomach. In the  week ended June 11 , Vioxx had  7 percent  of the Cox-2 market, with Celebrex taking the rest, according to the industry consultant  IMS Health .
But by  July 23 , Vioxx accounted for  22 percent  of total prescriptions, while Celebrex had fallen to  78 percent . " It's unlikely that Vioxx will ever catch up with Celebrex," said  Jack Lamberton , a managing director at  HSBC Securities . " But this market is large enough for both drugs." The stakes are unusually large. In an industry where earnings tend to rise  15 percent  or more a quarter,  Monsanto  and  Merck  need a blockbuster drug to remain competitive with other pharmaceutical companies. After its proposed merger with  American Home Products  fell apart last year,  Monsanto  announced a  $ 625 million  reorganization. Even though drug makers are generally suffering and the  Standard & Poor 's drug index is down  14.7 percent  this year,  Monsanto  has done worse.
Its stock has slid  17.1 percent  this year, to close  Monday  at  $ 39.375 , up  12.5 cents . Merck's situation does not appear as dire _ the company's stock is down only  8.6 percent  this year _ but analysts say the company can ill afford a marketing disaster. Several of  Merck 's drugs will lose their patent protection in the next few years, leaving the company vulnerable to eroding revenues as generic alternatives become available. And  Merck  is no longer Wall Street's darling. During the  last 12 months , shares of  Bristol-Myers Squibb  have climbed  18.6 percent . Meanwhile,  Merck 's shares have gained  10.7 percent . They closed  Monday  at  $ 67.375 , down  25 cents .
Stock analysts have high expectations for both new arthritis drugs. After Vioxx was introduced, analysts began ratcheting up their projected sales of it to an expected peak of about  $ 2.3 billion  a year sometime around  2004 , up from a peak estimate of  $ 1.5 billion  just months earlier. Celebrex's sales, meanwhile, are expected to be about  $ 3 billion  by  2004 . " Our marketing success with Vioxx will depend on the awareness of the brand," said  Wendy Dixon , a  Merck  vice president. " With a condition that involves pain, people talk to each other. A lot of the sales from Vioxx should be generated by word of mouth."  Willard Reese , a retired engineer from  Palm Coast ,  Fla. , suffered for years with arthritis pain before finding some relief three weeks ago after his doctor prescribed Vioxx.
" My doctor changed several of my medications,"  Reese  said. " But I have realized a marked improvement. My right hand is almost normal, when it was about  60 percent  functional before." Testimonials like his are sure to encourage arthritis sufferers to inquire about Vioxx and Celebrex. Except in rare cases, the drug that first racks up the largest share of a new market seldom relinquishes it. Celebrex, whose sales began in  January , had the most successful debut by a drug ever in the  United States , eclipsing such luminaries as Viagra,  Pfizer 's impotence pill, and Lipitor,  Warner-Lambert 's drug for reducing cholesterol, according to  IMS Health . " We're not looking over our shoulder at Vioxx," said  Joseph Papa , president of  U.S.  operations for  Searle , a division of  Monsanto .
" We're outperforming them on every measure." Merck, though, has been fast off the starting block. Known for its Marine-like marketing efficiency,  Merck  began shipping Vioxx to pharmacies two business days after it received approval from the  Food and Drug Administration . Merck has also distributed the most free samples in its history. The biggest selling point for Vioxx and Celebrex is that they may be less likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding than other arthritis remedies. ( STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) " Vioxx and Celebrex are safer on the gastrointestinal tract," said  Dr. Steven Abramson , the chairman of Rheumatology at the  Hospital of Joint Diseases  and the chairman of the  FDA Advisory Committee  that reviewed both drugs. In comparisons between Vioxx and Celebrex,  Merck  would like to focus on the two drugs' labels.

Vioxx has an indication for treatment of acute pain; Celebrex does not _ it has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The CSO drug is also single-dose. Celebrex can be administered in a single or double dose. Merck executives contend that Vioxx's single dose gives it an advantage over Celebrex since patients usually want to take as few pills as possible. Minerals Policy Committee has countered that Celebrex gives patients more options. " About  90 percent  of the people who use Celebrex for osteoarthritis take the 200-milligram pill once a day," Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer said. " If someone wants the flexibility, they can take the 100-milligram pill twice a day."

Along with doctors and consumers, health-maintenance organizations may hold part of the key to the drugs' acceptance. Several HMOs have restricted the use of one or both of the drugs.  Kaiser Permanente , which has 8.6 million members nationwide, has limited the use of the drugs to people who are at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Even though  Dr. David Campen , who chairs  Kaiser 's drug formulary committee, notes that the plan will cover any drug a doctor prescribes, he does not believe the plan should cover Vioxx and Celebrex. Campen has recently sent out questionnaires to some 50 doctors, and expects to render a decision in  September . The pills' prices might play a role. Vioxx is priced comparably with Celebrex, which has an average wholesale price of  $ 2.42  for its once-a-day pill.
 But when patients use Celebrex twice a day, the cost swells to  $ 2.86 . Both drugs cost considerably more than traditional generic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which run about  $ 1.70  for a daily dose.
