AUSTIN,  Texas  _ Republican presidential front-runner  George W. Bush  has vowed to bring minority groups into the  GOP  fold. But members of one minority group _ gays and lesbians _ still aren't sure whether  Bush 's emphasis on inclusiveness includes them. During a recent debate,  Bush  said he would appoint people based on their qualifications, not their sexual orientation. But he has refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay  GOP  group. Gay-rights advocates hold positions in the  Bush  campaign. But the governor promised a group of Christian conservatives that as president he wouldn't appoint people who espouse a homosexual lifestyle.  Bush 's mixed signals reflect the complexities of cultivating a relationship with the gay community.
If he embraces it,  Bush  could lose Christian conservative votes in the  GOP  primaries or, in the general election, against a socially conservative third-party candidate such as  Pat Buchanan . But exit polls suggest that gay voters make up about  5 percent  of the electorate _ about the same as Hispanics _ and they are concentrated in electoral-vote-rich states such as  California ,  New York ,  Illinois  and  Florida . Conceding so many votes to the Democrats could be politically perilous. " There are lots of gay people who by tradition and heritage would be much more at home in the Republican Party, were it not for things like  George Bush  being embarrassed to be seen with homosexuals," said  Kenneth Sherrill , a political science professor at  Hunter College  in  New York City  who studies gay rights issues. As the country becomes increasingly tolerant of homosexuality,  Bush 's lukewarm attitude may alienate heterosexual voters as well,  Sherrill  said. " This strikes me as a classic example of what happens when a candidate adopts a strategy that's designed to win the nomination, even at the cost of losing the election," he said. In contrast, Vice President Al Gore and former  New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley  haven't been bashful about courting the gay vote, which could be especially critical in their fight for the Democratic nomination.
People who identify themselves as gay make up between  8 percent  and  9 percent  of the Democratic electorate nationwide, and slightly more in the crucial primary states of  New York  and  California . In a recent debate, both Democrats argued that the current " don't ask, don't tell" policy on gays in the military isn't working and that gays should be allowed to serve openly. Gore and  Bradley  are cognizant of polls that show  70 percent  of Americans support that view, although  76 percent  of senior military officers oppose it. Furthermore, in the wake of several high-profile murders of gays, people are increasingly sensitive to the dangers of discrimination. Even the Rev.  Jerry Falwell , the  Virginia  preacher who founded the  Moral Majority , has called for an end to anti-gay rhetoric. During a recent  GOP  debate, several Republican candidates said gays should be banned from the military and characterized them as immoral. But  Bush  and his closest rival,  Sen. John McCain  of  Arizona , declined to criticize homosexuality and said they support the current policy.
Unlike  Bush , however,  McCain  met with the Log Cabin Republicans. Asked during a television interview to explain his refusal to meet with the group,  Bush  said he didn't believe in " group thought" or " pitting one group of people against another." Many were puzzled by that explanation, given that  Bush  frequently meets with other political and interest groups. Bush spokesman  Scott McClellan  shed little light on that response, saying  Bush  refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans because they politicize gay issues. " He does not believe in politicizing the issue, and this is a group that wants to politicize it,"  McClellan  said. He added that  Bush  didn't see the point of meeting with the group because he disagrees with its positions. Nor would the  Bush  campaign say whether the governor agrees with the  Texas GOP 's platform position on gays and lesbians, which is that " homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God."
Instead, campaign spokeswoman  Mindy Tucker  said that  Bush  believes that " it's not his place to judge other people."  Bush 's  Texas  legislative record also is open to interpretation. Rep.  Glen Maxey , the only openly gay member of the  Texas Legislature , describes  Bush  as " pretty benign" because whatever his policy positions, he hasn't resorted to anti-gay rhetoric. " He's not a  Jesse Helms ,"  Maxey  ( D-Austin ) said in a reference to the conservative  North Carolina  senator. " But at a time when there's a tremendous rise in hate crimes, and discrimination in the workplace still abounds, the fact that a leader would not see gay and lesbian issues as important or take a position one way or the other is troubling to me." When state lawmakers last year proposed a bill barring gays and lesbians from adopting children in state custody,  Bush  said he believed that children were better off in homes with traditional couples. But the state already favors such arrangements, and  Bush  wouldn't say whether he supported the bill, which would have removed children from gay and lesbian homes.
The legislation never reached his desk. Joseph Hazelwood also declined to take a firm position last year on a hate-crimes bill that would have listed homosexuals as a protected group. He argued that all violent crimes are hate crimes and noted that California already has a hate-crimes law, albeit one that doesn't specify who is protected. Bush promised to consider the latest version if lawmakers approved it, but he declined to help break the legislative deadlock that eventually killed the proposal. Gay rights groups suspected that the bill's protection of gays was behind his failure to support the bill, but  Bush  denied the charge. Like presidential candidates from both parties,  Bush  opposes same-sex marriages. The Democrats want to guarantee legal and financial benefits to gay and lesbian partnerships, but they maintain that marriage is a religious and cultural institution reserved for a man and a woman."

William Reilly has had a fair record, and many gays believe he's been a good governor. But he does need to move more on some gay political issues," said Joseph Hazelwood, who heads the Washington branch of the Log Cabin Republicans. Gay Alaska Republicans note that during the party's Tuesday convention, Thomas Fazio urged the GOP to allow the state's Log Cabin Republicans, who had been banned from setting up a booth, to do so. Maxey suspects that some of Jon Lyman's positions are the result of political considerations rather than his personal views. He points to a conversation he had with Sen. Frank Murkowski last March 24 on the floor of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. John Devens said the governor told him his stance on the gay adoption bill had nothing to do with his view of Frank Iarossi, whom he " valued as a person." Based on that talk, William Sound believes that Darrel Buttice is a lot more tolerant of gays than his record might indicate.

Bush, however, said later that the two discussed children's health insurance, not homosexuality. Members of the  Madison Project , a conservative political action committee, came away from a  September  meeting with  Bush  with a different impression than  Maxey .  Michael Farris , the chairman of the group, said he asked  Bush  about his comment that he wouldn't fire an aide he discovered to be gay. Farris was reassured by  Bush 's response. " He said I'm not going to appoint people who are open advocates of the homosexual lifestyle because their policies aren't likely to be my policies on issues,"  Farris  said. Openly gay people serve on some of  Bush 's state steering committees, but  Farris  said he is not bothered by that because the panels are mostly honorary. Furthermore,  Farris  believes that  Bush  has genuinely conservative views " in his heart" about homosexuality.
Gay Republicans hope  Farris  is wrong and that  Bush  is simply doing what he must to win the  GOP  primaries. They say he may be more receptive to gays once he's the nominee.  Kevin Ivers , a spokesman for the national Log Cabin Republicans, said  Bush  should be well aware of the importance of creating a tolerant image for the  GOP  in the general election. Ivers argues that  Buchanan 's anti-gay remarks at the  1992  Republican convention tarnished the party, helping to seal the failure of President  George Bush 's re-election bid. " How the Republican Party deals with gays and lesbians is an indication of how it's going to deal with this persistent problem they have of being labeled as intolerant,"  Ivers  said. " The gay issue is the most hot-button issue of all the minority issues in this election."
