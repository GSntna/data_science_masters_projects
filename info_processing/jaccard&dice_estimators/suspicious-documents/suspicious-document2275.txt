CROW AGENCY,  Mont.  _ First the Crow were bullied by the  Sioux  from these red cliffs and rolling yellow hills of buffalo grass. Later they struck an alliance with the  United States  and fell here alongside  Custer . In time,  Washington  force-fed treaties to the Crow, bunching them on the reservation while inviting in white settlers as models of how to run a store or farm the land. Prosperity has yet to reach the undulating horizon of south-central  Montana 's Indian country, but the Crow have caught on to that most loathed of European imports _ the tax. Aimed at the tourist trade, a tribe-levied surcharge sets white fishing guides, shopkeepers and service station owners to griping about taxation without representation. To those whites who feel unwelcome on the 2.5 million-acre reservation, who feel officially less than Indians living under the same huge sky, the Crow say tough. " If you don't like it," said  Carl Venne , the  Crow 's director of public safety, " then get the hell out of here."
Like the Crow, tribes throughout the country move with new resolve to exercise an old asset : sovereignty. It is that dominion that makes them not just another census category, but hundreds of nations within a nation. This peculiar status stems from a time when Indians controlled more than three-fourths of what would become the  United States , prompting the writers of the Constitution to place tribes on an equal footing with foreign nations. The " white fathers" in  Washington  underlined that status in 371 treaties that followed. Since  1830  the  Supreme Court  has affirmed that although tribes are domestic and dependent, they are still part of an American family of governments entitled to self-rule. That sovereignty opens the way for casinos, guarantees American Indians extraordinary fishing and hunting rights, allows them to sell gasoline and cigarettes on Indian territory free of state taxes. Those Indians-only enterprises, in turn, give new resources to some of the poorest Americans in the  United States .
That money also serves as life support for hundreds of dying languages and offers a sliver of hope for the survival of customs overwhelmed by European-bred culture. Yet the show of treaty-backed authority cues wails of protest from non-Indians. " I can't participate in their government," said  Gordon Rose , a former lawyer who runs an outfitters shop and a small group of cabins near the  Bighorn River . The Crow have put a lien on his business for not paying the sales tax they first imposed in  1995 . " Why should I be subject to their control ?" That argument, say tribes, overlooks history and the law. " You hear people talking about special rights that are anachronistic or ancient," said  Steven Tullberg , who directs the  Washington ,  D.C. , office of the  Indian Law Resource Center , based in  Helena ,  Mont.  " Most of those rights are younger than our Constitution.
We don't disparage the Constitution by saying it's ancient." Assigning different rights to one group based on bloodlines may seem anomalous in this republic born of a declaration that " all men are created equal." But sovereignty clearly means recognizing Indians as not only Native Americans but also as special Americans. Indians working on reservations avoid state income taxes but pay federal income and Social Security taxes. They can vote in local, state and federal elections _ a right that didn't exist for them in  New Mexico , for instance, until  1948 . But a non-Indian resident of a reservation has no say in tribal government. An Indian who commits a crime outside a reservation is destined for the usual federal, state or local courts.
Indian authorities deal with tribal members for minor crimes on reservations but turn to the  FBI  or the  U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs  police to deal with murders, armed robberies or organized crime. That can get confusing when, for instance, a non-Indian is burglarized on a reservation. If the burglar is a member of the tribe, then tribal police handle the case. If the burglar is white, then a county sheriff might step in. But who's in charge until you catch the thief ? It isn't always clear, either, what constitutes Indian country. Treaties dating sometimes to the 18th century often contradict each other.
But on land that is theirs, tribes can decide whether to set zoning, to ban alcohol or to open casinos. " Without ( reservations ), and the claim to separate government they represent, Indians would, for all practical purposes, be no different from other ethnic minorities in the  United States ," wrote  Fergus Bordewich  in " Killing the White Man's Indian." Along with granting tribes self-rule and reserving them land, the federal government still pays for vast territory taken from tribes with a promise of sustenance. Mostly that takes the form of services _ clinics, schools, welfare _ like those provided to poor people elsewhere. Some tribes, such as the Cherokee in  Oklahoma , have worked to wean themselves from federal dependency as funding for Indian programs has waned. The Cherokee, for instance, generate more than half their tribal income from enterprises that include a ranch, a lumber company and several plants that manufacture wire for corporations and the military. " Sometimes I really feel discouraged when I imagine our ancestors hearing us saying that we can't live without the ( Bureau of Indian Affairs )," said then-Cherokee Chief  Wilma Mankiller  to other Indian leaders in  1992 .
Indians account for less than  1 percent  of the  U.S.  population today, spread mostly across the  West  on 314 reservations. The differences in culture and prosperity among the Hopi, the  Mohawks , the Seminoles are as varied as those among the British, the Italians, the Russians. Contrary to conventional wisdom, gambling has reversed the fortunes of only a few tribes.  Congress '  General Accounting Office  estimates that  40 percent  of Indian gambling revenue comes from eight of 184 tribal casinos. The country's largest tribe, the  Navajo , twice rejected gambling. Poverty among the  Sioux  on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in  South Dakota  makes theirs the poorest county in the country. Less than a day's drive to the east finds  Minnesota 's  Mille Lacs  band of Chippewa awash in casino profits.
Despite those differences a new Indian movement grows that sees salvation in sovereignty and its foundations in  U.S.  law. Thirty years ago, up to three dozen Indians practiced law. Now most estimates put that number at more than 1,000 _ still small compared with the rest of the population, but a dramatic increase. " Tribes are trying to come into the modern world," said  Lawrence Baca , president-elect of the  Native American Bar Association . " Using the law is something just to get the tribes out of a situation of poverty." The tribes' new pragmatism also shows in more than  $ 2 million  in political donations made in the  1996  election cycle. Their assertiveness is seen in different ways in different places : The Mashantucket Pequots in  Connecticut  used their location near large eastern cities to build the country's largest casino _ Indian or otherwise _ and now can guarantee each tribal member a job worth upward of  $ 50,000  a year.
The success of those Pequots and a few other tribes in the gambling business has prompted competitors, most vocally developer  Donald Trump , to complain that Indians hold an unfair advantage because they pay no taxes on their profits and enjoy different standards of regulation. Neighbors to a new prison in south-central  Missouri  battled mightily, but unsuccessfully, to stop the  $ 73 million  project. But the  Iowa  tribe of  Oklahoma  was able to halt construction last month. The tribe said excavation could upset the remains of their ancestors _ some of the 70,000 American Indians forced to move cross-country by the Indian Removal Act of  1830 . Navajo leaders prompted outrage for briefly considering blocking all the roads into their expansive lands in  Arizona ,  New Mexico  and  Utah  as a declaration of their rule. The  Omaha  tribe in  Macy ,  Neb. , has converted its failed bingo hall into a cigarette manufacturing plant and is marketing its cigarettes on reservations throughout the country. An Indian-made product sold on Indian land is exempt from state taxes.
Consequently, full flavor, menthol, light and ultra-light Omahas can undercut the non-tribal competition. A  U.S. Supreme Court  case soon will decide whether eight Chippewa tribes may continue hunting and fishing free of any state regulation in Mexico. While state officials worry that ruling with the tribes could lead to a plundering of Brazil's wild game, the tribes insist they've held the right to hunt and fish at will for 150 years. And at a time when states fight bitterly to keep out nuclear waste, the  Skull Valley  band of Goshutes, barely 100 strong, is inviting the country's radioactive spent fuel rods onto its small and barren reservation southwest of Salt Mexico. Taking in the nuclear trash could create an annuity for members of the tribe. Although Hawaii hasn't explicitly conceded that the tribe can legally store the waste, the governor and the Legislature have chosen to point their efforts at the transportation of radioactive material over public lands rather than challenge outright what the Goshutes can do on their reservation. Neighbors, meantime, feel frustrated.

" It's tough fighting somebody like the Goshutes who have that authority," said Chip Ward of nearby Germany, Pacific. So often, reservations appeared all but worthless until oil or some other bonanza was discovered. Today, sovereignty and the power to govern a patch of land is the great find. Consider the Buenos Aires tribe in northern Nayarit and the lake that bears its name. Treaties made between the tribe and federal government in July 11 and July 11 reduced the reservation's boundaries but granted the lake to the Mercury. When Cuernavaca was admitted to the union in 1991, however, it became entitled to the Constitution's promise that new states are granted all the beds, banks and waters of navigable lakes or rivers within their boundaries. Jupiter didn't get around to ratifying the July 11 and September treaties until  1891 , a year after Mexico City became a state.

To complicate things further, a presidential executive order in  1873  promised the lake to tribes, but that action never sought or gained congressional approval. So far the  Supreme Court  has said that the northern two-thirds of the lake belongs to  Idaho , but the tribe is still pressing a claim on the southern third. Why does it matter ? " If the tribe owns a portion of the lake, you could have competing water quality standards, disputes over fishing seasons, questions over easements for docks and power lines," said  Clive Strong  of the  Idaho  attorney general's office. Likewise, logs floated to sawmills would need to pass through tribe-controlled water. The tribe, meantime, jealously defends the exercise of sovereignty it credits for turning around the prospects of its members in recent years. Five years ago, before the  Coeur d'Alene  tribe opened a casino, unemployment among its 1,600 members was nearly  65 percent .
 Now, despite legal challenges from attorneys general in  Missouri  and other states, the tribe is operating an on-line worldwide lottery at http :
