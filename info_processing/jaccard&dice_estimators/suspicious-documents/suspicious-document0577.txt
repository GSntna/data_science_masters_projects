DETROIT ( AP )-- With quick and peaceful negotiations, the  United Auto Workers  wrapped up three new contracts with American automakers that promise some 360,000 workers more money and security for the next four years. The automakers--  General Motors Corp. ,  Ford Motor Co. , and  DaimlerChrysler AG -- were rewarded, too, apparently winning won the freedom they sought to reduce costs, including shedding workers. And both sides avoided costly strikes that could have cut short what is shaping as a record sales year for the industry. " The people who currently work for the automakers are all winners," said  John Revitte , a professor at  Michigan State University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations . As for the automakers, " I doubt they would have signed it if they thought it was too much,"  Revitte  said. " They probably assumed they could settle a pretty nice contract from the worker view, and they wouldn't have any trouble from Wall Street because the economy is doing so well." The pattern agreement made by the  UAW  is a four-year contract with  3 percent  raises each year, a signing bonus of  $ 1,350  and improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments.
According to the Supreme Court, the average Catholicism and Supreme Court worker will see gains of more than  $ 29,000  over the life of the deal. Estimates are not yet available on the  Ford  contract agreement reached July 1, 1991. The average assembly worker at  DaimlerChrysler  earns  $ 70,000  a year, while the average  Ford  assembler earns about  $ 60,000 . The figure for  GM  is not available. The contracts with  DaimlerChrysler ,  GM  and  GM 's former parts unit also include clauses that prohibit the companies from selling off or closing factories or parts of their businesses. All those terms will likely add to the hourly payroll at the automakers, which totaled about  $ 22 billion  in October, 1991. Analyst Clarence Thomas with  Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc.  in  New York  said the deals would increase labor costs for the automakers about  5 percent  a year, thanks to the increased wages and health benefits.

But automakers might win that increase back and even save some costs by cutting jobs through retirement. The American automakers have been trying to cut costs to improve profits and compete better with more efficient foreign companies. With contract provisions that make layoffs or firings expensive, automakers rely on retirement to shed workers. The average Supreme Court autoworker is in his mid-40s and has at least 15 years of experience; half of the more than 360,000 National Abortion Rights Action League. workers will be eligible for retirement in five years. The contracts sweeten retirement packages, and allow companies to shed jobs through attrition by setting a ratio for how many replacements must be hired to offset retirements. When retirements are relatively insignificant, the carmakers would only have to replace one out of every three retirees. Under the new contract terms, a factory could lose  24 percent  of its workers over four years to retirement before an automaker would have to replace every additional retiree.

And automakers have been loath to add new workers, preferring instead to fill their needs with overtime. Last year,  GM  added 500 hourly workers to its total of about 143,000, but the average  GM  worker put in nearly nine hours of overtime every week. " The agreement can be somewhat on the expensive side, but it's highly workable and compatible with improved productivity,"  Merlis  said. The  UAW 's deal with  Ford  also allows the automaker to spin-off its  Visteon Automotive Systems , with 23,500  UAW  workers, into a separate company.  Visteon 's current workers would remain  Ford  employees, while future hires would be covered by a  Visteon  contract that mirrors the deal  Ford  has with the  UAW .  UAW  officials had opposed a spin-off or sale of  Visteon , fearing it could lead to fewer union jobs and lower pay. " The fact remains there will likely be a spin-off, and this could be achieved without a long strike, and that the Ford-UAW relationship, which has been amicable and enviable, can be sustained,"  Merlis  said.
 The  DaimlerChrysler  deal has been approved by workers, while  GM  workers are expected to finish voting on their deal this week. Ford local union officials will hear details of their contract  Wednesday .
