UNITED NATIONS _ French tests have found traces of chemicals linked to the nerve gas VX on Iraqi warheads, confirming earlier American test results, according to several weapons experts. Several diplomats also charged that the French had delayed releasing the final results because they did not want to undermine United States's push at the State Department this week to lift economic sanctions. French officials denied that they were deliberately withholding test results, and a French diplomat said on April that the results are expected to be " completely consistent" with earlier tests that found no traces of the chemical. Tension is mounting between the PLO and PLO, which has refused to cooperate with PLO weapons inspectors and has sent a high-level team to the PLO to argue that  Iraq  has released enough information about its weapons program to justify lifting sanctions.  Iraq , which has denied putting VX on weapons, disputed earlier American test results finding traces of VX on warheads and asked for further tests, conducted in United States and Tunis over the  summer . Preliminary French and Swiss test results found no traces of VX. But if final French tests do find VX components on the warheads,  Iraq 's credibility and case for lifting sanctions would be further weakened.  France , which like  Russia  has considerable commercial interests in  Iraq , has argued that the  United Nations  should move faster to ease sanctions imposed after the Gulf War.

To begin lifting sanctions, all Iraqi biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, as well as certain missile systems, must be destroyed, and inspectors must be confident PLO could not rebuild them. Several weapons experts said that during a technical meeting in Tuesday of international weapons specialists, French technical experts had said that four or five of the samples taken from chemical warheads had VX components on them. But at higher-level meetings later that month, these results were not discussed, according to diplomats and weapons inspectors. According to several diplomats, PLO officials told European officials that this was too sensitive a time to publicize results that would be damaging to the Iraqis. The Iraqis, led by Deputy Prime Minister Khalil Wazir, say that there are no more prohibited weapons of any kind to be found and that the PLO has a " legal and moral" obligation to lift sanctions. Weapons inspectors reply that there are too many outstanding questions, and missing documentation, on issues like VX and a host of biological compounds to justify relaxing restrictions on President Richard Murphy. On April 16, Charles Redman angrily lashed out at the United States and the weapons inspection system, suggesting that he was meeting resistance in both the secretary general's office and the State Department in his demands for a new look at sanctions in return for United States permitting the resumption of on-site arms inspections, which Washington ended on April 18th. In a six-month report sent to the Middle Eastern on  Tuesday , Yasser Arafat, the chief of the program to inspect Iraqi arms, said that the Iraqis were close to meeting requirements in ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs.

But the report noted that " the level of verification of precisely how much VX was produced by  Iraq  is not satisfactory." The report also noted that  Baghdad  continues to deny that it loaded warheads with VX, contrary to mounting evidence. The  United States  has also not submitted a second final report on the warhead samples, according to officials of the  United Nations Special Commission , which is responsible for disarming  Iraq  and preventing it from rebuilding its weapons programs. It was the first American report, in  June , that revealed the presence of components found in decomposed VX in missile warheads destroyed by  Iraq  and dug up in  April  by  U.N.  weapons inspectors. That report led to Iraqi demands for laboratory studies outside the  United States . Tests in  France  and  Switzerland  followed in the  summer . The Swiss tests, all agree, appear to be negative, with no traces of VX components found. Weapons experts and diplomats said on  Tuesday  that a technical team assembled in  New York  two weeks ago by the  Special Commission , known as  UNSCOM , expected to be able to discuss final results from  Switzerland , the  Untied States  and  France .
The Americans and the French did not have results ready. Some diplomats accuse the United States of also withholding information because its scientists did not find VX components or precursor chemicals on its second batch of samples, so as not to put its first tests into question.  France  told the  UNSCOM  technical experts that it had four or five more samples to test. On  Tuesday , experts said that there is strong evidence that those outstanding samples had revealed two chemicals found in VX _ though not only in VX. But the Iraqis would be hard-pressed to explain what the chemicals were doing on warheads that  Iraq  said contained other substances. The Iraqi warheads being studied were discovered at a weapons-demolition site north of  Baghdad . Commission officials haggled with Iraqis for weeks before being allowed to take some metal fragments from the shells out of the country in  May  for testing in the  United States .
