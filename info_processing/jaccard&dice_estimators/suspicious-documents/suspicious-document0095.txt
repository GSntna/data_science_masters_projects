As a very young child,  Alex Fenyn , now 7, exasperated his parents and teachers and intimidated peers with his hyperactive and aggressive behavior. He was extremely cranky as an infant and had a bloodcurdling scream that made him sound like he was being tortured, says his mother,  Tracy McNair , 42, a consultant from  New York City . His parents even gave him the nickname " Mr. Intensity." In preschool and kindergarten, he was impulsive and unable to sit down. Because  Alex 's classmates found his behavior so frightening, he was usually left to play by himself. The turning point in  Alex 's life came at age 5, with a clinical diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a prescription for Ritalin, which his mother describes as a " miracle drug." " The effect was immediate," she says.
" He had less trouble going from one activity to the next and would negotiate for a toy instead of grabbing it. After three weeks, his classmates started to warm up to him, which is what I was hoping for. I wanted him to gain some self-esteem." In what many see as a kind of vast, national experiment, millions of children in the  United States  are taking drugs prescribed by doctors to help manage mental and emotional health problems at ever-younger ages. And the number of kids on medication is rising. A study by  Dr. Julie Magno Zito  at the  University of Maryland School of Pharmacy  in  Baltimore  found that as many as  1.5 percent  of American children between the ages of 2 and 4 are taking stimulants such as Ritalin, as well as antidepressants and antipsychotics. According to  Zito 's findings, stimulant use in this age group (  Ritalin  in  90 percent  of the cases ) rose two- to threefold from  1991  to  1995 , while the rate of antidepressant prescriptions nearly doubled during the same time period.
As more and more kids begin taking medications for psychiatric problems, the lack of safety data is becoming an urgent problem, especially in younger age groups, says  Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz , vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the  New York University School of Medicine  in  New York City . " We have a critical need to conduct further studies of the long-term safety of these medications in children," he says. Dr.  Jerry Rushton , a pediatrician at the  University of Michigan School of Medicine  in  Ann Arbor , says that clinicians simply know more about childhood mental illnesses now than they did in the past _ and with this knowledge has come a rise in the number of diagnoses and prescriptions. According to  Rushton , heightened awareness among clinicians stems in part from mental health research conducted during the  1990s , which provided evidence that identifiable, biologically-based mental illnesses, such as depression, can occur in children as young as 2 or 3 years old. Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions, says  Rushton , is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil, which have fewer, less serious side effects than the previous generation of antidepressants. They have been increasingly prescribed over the last decade by pediatricians for treating depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety in children. Does the rising use of medications indicate that rates of mental illnesses are actually increasing among children ?
" For over a decade there have been observations among teachers and pediatricians of increasing behavioral disturbances in children," says  Dr. Barry Zuckerman , chairman of the department of pediatrics at the  Boston University School of Medicine . " We don't know if it has to do with changing communities, family structure, TV video games or anything else, but there is a perception that behavioral disturbances are on the rise." A case in point is ADHD, which has become increasingly common in the years since it was first described by the  American Psychiatric Association  in  1980 . In  1987 , the  APA  redefined the criteria for diagnosing ADHD to include individuals with either hyperactivity or impulsive behavior, and not necessarily both, as was previously the case. The result was a skyrocketing increase in the number of ADHD diagnoses. Figures released by the  APA  in  May  indicate that anywhere from  4 percent  to  12 percent  of all American children _ some 2.5 million _ are now thought to have the disorder, making it the most common pediatric mental illness in the  United States . And according to  Zito , the dramatic rise in prescriptions for Ritalin can be linked directly to the increased national caseload of pediatric ADHD.
Parents who consult a professional about their child's behavior will likely confront a managed care system widely viewed by clinicians and patients as inadequate or unresponsive where mental health coverage is concerned. " There is no doubt that when it comes to mental illness, managed care interferes with diagnosis," says  Dr. Alan Wachtel , a clinical associate professor at  New York University Medical Center  in South Carolina and author of " The Attention Deficit Disorder Answer Book." Many insurance companies restrict access to psychiatric specialists, limit the number of visits for psychotherapy and encourage primary care physicians to prescribe medications rather than to try longer-term psychosocial interventions. And, according to  Koplewicz , most children are evaluated for mental illness not by child psychiatrists, but by pediatricians, many of whom have little training in mental health. By refusing to cover the cost of psychiatric referrals, managed care companies are limiting the resources available to pediatricians, he says, which may add pressure to reach for the prescription pad. Experts, including  Koplewicz , say that children with mental illness who don't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative self-esteem and poor relationships with others, and are at a much higher risk of delinquency, occupational problems and suicide later on in life. If you are worried that your pediatrician can not devote the time needed to conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation because of an overwhelming schedule, ask for a recommendation to a qualified expert who can conduct a thorough assessment, which should include in-depth interviews with the child, parents and teachers, and a review of school records and family history.

Unfortunately, many pediatricians feel pressure to prescribe medications for mental and emotional health problems simply as a way to do something for a child in light of the limitations managed care places on physicians, says Dr. William Gray, the director of the Center for the Colorado State University at the National Hurricane Center in Atlantic. But, he says, the decision to medicate should be based on the severity of the child's illness as determined by a comprehensive evaluation that takes into account the age and developmental maturity of the child. In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted, a team of researchers at six sites around the country, led by Gilbert, followed 579 children with ADHD for 14 months to assess their progress with various forms of treatment. The researchers found that medication was substantially more effective than behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone. In cases where children had problems in addition to ADHD, such as depression or anxiety, combining medication with behavior therapy provided an advantage. Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving. Because so few of these studies have been completed, a consensus among experts on the benefits of medication over psychosocial approaches has yet to emerge.

Ultimately, parents need to discuss all the available treatment options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed decision about what will be best for their child, says  Koplewicz . After the evaluation, he says, " the critical thing is that you as a parent understand the diagnosis, as well as the benefits and risks of each treatment option under consideration." (  Charles W.
