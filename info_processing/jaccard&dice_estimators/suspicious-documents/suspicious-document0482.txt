Was  TJ Maxx  trying to promote a more youthful corporate culture when a young manager at a  New Jersey  store fired several employees over 40 ? Talk to  Sherry Lang , spokeswoman for  TJX Cos.  in  Framingham ,  Mass. , and her response is an emphatic " No." " By policy, this company does not discriminate against anyone for any reason," says  Lang . " We believe their claims have no merit, none at all." A class-action lawsuit filed by the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  last fall alleges  TJX Cos. , parent of the retail chain, had exposed older employees to unfair discipline since  August 1995 . Much of the case centers around 59-year-old  Betty Heyner , a former sales clerk who claims she was railroaded out of her job back in  1995  because of her age. Heyner is alleging that many of the problems she experienced while running the jewelry counter at a suburban  New Jersey  store stemmed from a young supervisor's brash managerial style and unorthodox work habits.  Heyner 's former manager could not be reached by telephone to comment.
But if allegations in the case illustrate anything at all, it is that tensions between Generation Xers and senior employees are not uncommon, and when younger managers are in charge of older workers emotions are apt to heighten. There are now 45 million Generation Xers, born between  1965  and  1977 . Self-starters who would rather be in the driver's seat than wait their turn, many twentysomethings are now moving into coveted managerial positions, jobs baby boomers waited years to get. " Generation Xers are really the forerunners of a new career paradigm, and they think of themselves as free agents," says  Bruce Tulgan , founder of Rainmaker Thinking, a New Haven consulting firm that helps companies better understand this generation. " They move into positions of power quickly because they don't do things the old way, and many are really trying to be the kind of manager they wanted to have." What kind of manager is that ? Managers who sidestep rules that get in the way.
Managers who aren't afraid to take chances. Not surprising, baby boomer employees often describe these new managers as brash, audacious, arrogant, and, yes, a bit threatening. " Older workers often feel that companies are looking for younger people, that they can bring in people who are younger on a temporary basis and not pay benefits," says psychologist  Bruce Cedar , a workplace consultant at  CMG Associates  in  Newton . " The older worker feels more vulnerable. When you get younger mangers in, oftentimes I've heard it said that older employees feel even more threatened," notes Cedar. " They feel younger people are simply looking for ways to get rid of older, more expensive workers. This is coming from what individuals feel, and is certainly not based on any company policy."
The workplace of the Wednesday might seem threatening, even volatile, to baby boomers. Generation Xers, by contrast, have experienced little else but change, and they thrive on it. " Generation Xers disdain authority for the sake of authority," says  Tulgan , author of " Managing Generation X" (  1995  Merritt Publishing,  $ 19.95  ). " So, most of the young people who are moving into positions of power tend to soft pedal their authority because of perceived hostility." And that can cause problems in the workplace. " Sometimes they soft pedal their authority so much that when things go wrong, they go ballistic," notes  Tulgan  " And there may be awkwardness with authority, which can be manifested by inappropriate behavior." Heyner claims her 21-year-old manager had temper tantrums and blew up at her without cause.

" One day I saw her blow up, right at the store," says Jeff Bryant. " I was stunned. She started throwing papers around and yelling. She didn't like the way ( the jewelry ) was being displayed. The whole thing was shocking." Experts stress most Generation X managers take their responsibilities seriously. But they don't want to be held back by policies such as seniority.

" There is a myth out there that these young people, as managers, are slackers," said  Tulgan . " That's not true. These are people who have come of age during the most profound changes in our economy since the Industrial Revolution. For boomers, downsizing and reorganizing and re-engineering may seem totally revolutionary and frightening. But to  Generation Xers , that's just the way things are. They grew up with it, and they are taking advantage of the changes and transformations." Still, experts say, companies would do well to offer these young managers what they crave most : training, plenty of feedback, clear goals, and monthly rewards for job performance.
