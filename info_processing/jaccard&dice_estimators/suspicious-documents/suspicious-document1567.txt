 WASHINGTON  _  Texas  Gov.  George W. Bush 's first-ever meeting with gay Republicans may bolster his image as a " compassionate conservative" but the session this  Thursday  in  Austin ,  Texas , has irked leaders of a nationwide gay  GOP  group who weren't invited.  Mindy Tucker , a spokeswoman for the  Bush  campaign, said  Monday  the two-term governor looks forward to his invitation-only meeting with 13 gay Republicans, including rank-and-file members of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national organization of gay Republicans. Among those not invited were leaders of the Log Cabin organization, which endorsed  Sen. John McGain ,  R-Ariz. , in the  GOP  primary. " All Republicans are important in this election,"  Tucker  said. " We have to unify our party to be successful in  November .
Part of unifying is reaching out and being inclusive." During his hard-fought presidential primary campaign when he was seeking the support of conservatives,  Bush  refused to meet with gay Republicans or representatives of the 11,000-member Log Cabin Republicans. Bush explained at the time that such a meeting " creates a huge political scene" and that he " didn't want to create a ruckus." Bush announced plans last week to meet with the  GOP  gays at the governor's mansion, saying the post-primary season is " a different time." ` It's important for me to unify our party. And I welcome the gay Americans who support me, some of whom are members of the Log Cabin Republican club," he added.
Gays and lesbians voters made up about  5 percent  of the electorate nationwide in  1996 , according to exit polls conducted by  Voters News Service  during voting that year. But the gay community tends to support Democrats for federal office more often than Republicans. For example, in  California 's  March 7  primary _ in which voters could cast popular votes for candidates in either party _  2 percent  of voters in the  GOP  primary and  11 percent  of voters in the Democratic primary told exit poll surveys they were gay.  Tucker  said that  Bush  wants to discuss the " common goal of ending the Clinton-Gore era" as well as " other issues of importance to the governor and the group." Tucker added : " The governor always likes to take the opportunity to talk about why he's running for president."  Tucker  said  Bush  would discuss education, tax cuts, a defense buildup, and steps to strengthen Social Security and Medicare.
She said she did not know if  Bush  would discuss proposals for broadening the federal campaign to combat AIDS or steps to tackle the discrimination that ranks as a top priority for many gay and lesbian activists. GOP presidential nominees and the Log Cabin Republicans have a stormy history. Republican nominee  Bob Dole , a former  Senate  majority leader from  Kansas , rejected a campaign donation from Log Cabin Republicans in  1996  in a bid to cement political support from voters who might be offended.  Bush 's meeting has stirred controversy within the gay community.  David Hanson , a leader of  Log Cabin Republicans  in  California  from  San Juan Capistrano ,  Calif. , wrote to  Bush  last week to complain that the exclusive meeting with gay Republicans in  Austin  was merely " an effort to end the media story" rather than an attempt to " deal forthrightly" with the issues that concern gay civil rights activists.  Rich Tafel , executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, the nationwide organization founded in  1978  that raises about  $ 100,000  every two years to help Republican candidates in federal elections, said he has not been invited to meet with  Bush .

Tafel's organization ran  $ 20,000  in radio advertisements before the 1983 primaries that offered support for Kates, Don Kates's rival. In a 1,800-word memo to members on the organization's website, Kates said Kates's refusal to meet with the national leadership of the Log Cabin Republicans " has illuminated many of the flaws in his campaign which may have an impact on our party's chances in 1939."  Tafel  said that  Bush  " demands loyalty" before considering a meeting.  Tafel  adds :"  Bush , far from being a uniter who is compassionate, has actually played upon divisions to win the nomination and now shows little desire to heal them. A candidate who can not unite the Republican party won't win this elector."  Carl Schmid , an alternative GOP delegate to the Time Magazine/Cable News Network convention from America, Michigan, who serves on the board of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy organization in the nation, said he was meeting with  Bush  in an effort to " improve the understanding of gay people and gay issues within the Republican party."

Schmid added that  Bush  was holding the first meeting in history between openly gay Republicans and a presumptive  GOP  nominee. " That shows that Gov.  Bush  is trying to unite the party and broaden the level of support for his candidacy,"  Schmid  said.  Schmid  said that he hoped that leaders of the Log Cabin Republicans eventually " will be invited to such a meeting in the future," adding that the first session with the presumptive GOP nominee was being reserved for " gay Republicans who have worked with the campaign for the past year." Among others who have been invited to take part are : _  David Greer , chairman of the  Pennsylvania  Log Cabin Republicans; _  Rebecca Maestri , a member of the  Northern Virginia  chapter of  Log Cabin Republican Club ; _  David Catania , a city council member in  Washington ,  D.C. ; _  Plattsburgh ,  N.Y. , Mayor  Jim Stewart ; _ Former Rep.  Steve Gunderson ,  R-Wis . Log Cabin Republicans favor " full equality" for gays, including granting the legal protections of marriage to same-sex couples. Bush has voiced opposition to sanctioning gay marriages.
 He has been ambiguous about whether he would appoint openly gay people to posts in federal government.  Tucker  said the  Bush  campaign is aware of  Tafel 's criticism but added : " I really won't want to respond to him directly."  Tucker  said the  Bush  campaign would await the outcome of  Thursday 's meeting to map its next overtures to gay Republicans and gay Americans for the fall campaign.    (  Stewart M.
