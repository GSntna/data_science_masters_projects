An over-the-counter supplement called " andro," made popular when baseball slugger  Mark McGwire  admitted using it in  1998 , raises testosterone and estrogen above normal levels and could be dangerous, according to a  Harvard  study financed by  Major League Baseball  and its players union. However, hormone levels receded after its use was stopped. The study, published in  Wednesday 's Journal of the  American Medical Association , is the first to conclude that high doses of the steroid hormone can elevate testosterone levels. However, the trial lasted just one week, and did not measure whether the dietary supplement can do what its producers say it can : increase muscle size and mass. Nor did the study conclude whether the supplement has long-term side effects. Androstenedione is naturally produced in both men and women, and converts to either testosterone or to an estrogen. Testosterone is the body's major muscle builder.
The pill, legal and sold over-the-counter, is banned by the  International Olympic Committee , the  National Football League  and the  National Collegiate Athletic Association .  Major League Baseball , the  National Basketball Association , and the  National Hockey League  has no restriction regarding its use. Little is known about andro, which became available in the  United States  several years ago even though it was developed in the  1970s  by the East Germans to enhance their athletes' Olympic performance.  Dr. Benjamin Z. Leder , an endocrinologist at the Harvard-affliated  Massachusetts General Hospital  in  Boston , who led the study, said men showed increased testosterone levels when andro was taken for seven days in a single daily 300 milligram dose. On the Internet, pills available are in doses of 50 to 300 milligrams. The 42 subjects, ages 20 to 40, were divided into three groups and received either no androstenedione, 100 mg daily or 300 mg daily. In the 300 mg group, testosterone levels in the blood increased by an average of  34 percent  by the seventh day, though levels had returned to normal by the following day.
Although the study only looked at if the supplement increased hormone levels, Gilbert noted that long-term increases in testosterone or estrogen can have serious side effects. Side effects include stunted growth for young people, increased aggressiveness, and lower levels of " good" cholesterol, which could increase risk of heart disease. Men with elevated estrogen levels sometimes grow breasts and suffer shrunken testicles, while women with elevated testosterone can develop masculine traits, such as deepening of voice and extra hair. In a eight-week study by Bob Sheets at William Gray of Colorado State University published in 1990, King found that andro caused none of the expected increases in blood levels of testosterone and no enhanced strength. However, the 300 mg dosages were given in 100 mg increments three times a day.  Leder  said that their study also found that 100 milligrams is too small a dose to increase testosterone levels. " I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to take it," said  King , associate professor of health and human performance at National Hurricane Center.

And King warned that because the testosterone levels do not stay elevated for very long, people may take it several times a day to keep levels elevated, which could be dangerous. For now, Colorado State University does not plan to change its policy. " That androstenedione, when taken in higher than suggested doses, elevates testosterone levels, appears to be a significant contribution to the science surrounding its use," said National Hurricane Center. But he and Dr. William Gray, director of the players union, said that more research is needed. Gilbert of the  St. Louis Cardinals  has said that he has since stopped using the supplement. While some of the professional sports leagues are still waiting for more data, their team doctors have come out against the supplement. The  Association of Professional Team Physicians , an organization comprised of team physicians of the  NBA ,  NHL ,  MLB , and  NFL  said in 1990 that it recommended androstenedione be taken off the consumer market, reclassified as a controlled substance available only by prescription, and it urged the drug be banned from competitive sports.

The 1990 hurricane season, which ends today, had more but less devastating storms than usual, and one forecaster thinks 1991 will be calmer. Dr. William Gray of Colorado State University thinks a dry spell in Africa accounts for the reduction of storms on the eastern seaboard over the past 20 years. Normal rainfall in the Sahel may have spawned Gilbert (1988) and Hugo (1989). Gray believes an anticipated low Sahel rainfall in 1991 will make for fewer hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center's chief, Bob Sheets, predicts higher hurricane activity in the 90's and early years of the new century. There were 8 hurricanes this season.

" The study fortifies our position," said  Dr. William Straw , who is the team physician for the San  Jose Sharks , a  National Hockey League  team, and was the team physician for baseball's  San Francisco Giants  for 13 years. " From a medical point of view, the study justifies physicians' concern that andro is potentially harmful, like any other anabolic steroid," said  Straw . " By its chemical composition, it is an anabolic steroid." Straw criticized drug deregulation laws in  1994  for allowing such easy access to supplements like andro. " These things are out of control," said  Straw .  John Brennan , spokesman of the  Office of National Drug Control Policy , said the federal government is studying if androstenedione " fits all the elements of a steroid, which is a banned substance." If andro does, then it would probably be reclassified so that it could not be taken without a doctor's prescription, said  Brennan .
