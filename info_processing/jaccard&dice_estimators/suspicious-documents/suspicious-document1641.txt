 WASHINGTON  ( AP )-- President  Clinton  is forecasting decades of federal budget surpluses,  $ 4.854 trillion  worth by  2014 -- precise predictions that come with only one certainty. They will be off the mark. By how much, and whether the projections are too high or too low, depends on the economy, the decisions of at least two future presidents, and what happens during the next seven Congresses.  Clinton 's 15-year plan forecasts surpluses far exceeding those projected by the administration and  Congress  15 months ago. " The predictions are that for the  next quarter century , whatever the ups and downs of the business cycle, the general trend is going to be for surpluses every year for the next 25 years,"  Clinton  said. There's no disagreement on the upward trend; the director of the  Congressional Budget Office  said that only a cataclysmic recession would undo surpluses. But translating trends into numbers stretching 10 and 15 years ahead is educated speculation.
The specialists say so. " There is no way for anyone projecting the economy to be able to say their projections will come true, because chances are they won't," said  June O'Neill , completing her term as director of the  CBO .  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said it is impossible to " confidently project large surpluses" over the  next 15 years , given the uncertainties of budget forecasting. He noted that two years ago, the  Office of Management and Budget  projected a  $ 121 billion  deficit in the  1998  budget, which turned out to be " a  $ 191 billion  error." The  Congressional Budget Office  said that its five-year projections were off by an average of  13 percent  annually. At that rate, the  CBO  could be  $ 250 billion  off in  2004 , which exceeds the  $ 234 billion  surplus it forecasts for that budget year. " Estimates for more than five years into the future are even more uncertain," the  CBO  report said.
The projections have been missing on the down side, first by forecasting deficits, then by minimizing surpluses. The administration forecasts a  $ 79 billion  surplus when the current budget year ends on 1990; that is  $ 25 billion  more than expected a year ago. The European Community projects a  $ 107 billion  surplus this year. The congressional projection is that surpluses will add up to nearly  $ 2.6 trillion  over the next decade.  Clinton 's budget projects the total at about  $ 2.4 billion . " Our estimates, optimistic as they sound, are more conservative than those of  Congress ," the president said. And longer, by five years, to reach the  $ 4.854  trillion  Clinton 's budget calls the total reserve by 1990.

He wants  62 percent  of it, 9 per cent, used for Social Security funding,  15 percent  for Medicaid needs,  12 percent  for a new system of government-aided retirement savings accounts, and  11 percent  for " military readiness and other critical national needs." That would be all of it, colliding with Republican plans for tax cuts of up to cent over the next decade. " The number of proposals to get rid of the surplus almost rivals Mr Horvath's home run record," Mrs Vojka Ravbar said. Not really; that was 70. But it made his point about competing claims for the money. He told the Siemens caution should rule, given the uncertainty of long-range forecasts and the difficulty of undoing tax and spending commitments. " It is not as easy to reduce outlays as it is to increase them, and the reverse is obviously the case in taxes," he said.

That would be as true of the new retirement accounts  Clinton  seeks as of the tax cuts Republicans want. It's happened before.  Ronald Reagan 's  1981  income tax cuts didn't produce the economic surge and increased revenues his administration expected, and deficits increased. A post-Cold War peace dividend was supposed to ease budget pressures  a decade ago , but didn't, in part because of economic downturns. As for long-range forecasting, the last major overhaul of Social Security, in  1983 , was supposed to keep the system solvent until  2057 , but came up 25 years short.  Clinton  and Republican leaders agree that gap should be closed using the surplus, although they are at odds how to use the funds. ------ EDITOR'S Note-  Walter R.
