CONYERS,  Ga.  ( AP )--  Jim Borland  came home from a business trip  last month  to find his 18-year-old son,  Graham , gripped by news of carnage at a high school in  Littleton ,  Colo.  " You know, this could happen in our school system," the teen-ager recalls warning his dad. " We need to take more precautions." Jim  Borland  agreed. As a school board member for  Rockdale County , he was in a good position to respond. Safety measures already were in place, and administrators quickly reinforced them. But that couldn't stop a 15-year-old from opening fire  Thursday , wounding six students and adding  Heritage High School  to the list of campus bloodbaths that have shocked and frustrated the nation. The shooting in  Rockdale County , a semirural setting of 68,000 mostly white, comfortable and churchgoing inhabitants, 25 miles east of  Atlanta , suggests that even an elaborate safety system may not be enough.
Under measures adopted a few years ago, Rockdale schools already employed armed police during school hours, according to schools spokeswoman  Susan Paul Smith . Video cameras already watched kids on school buses and in the schools. Trained dogs periodically came to sniff for drugs. Earlier this year, when  Thomas Solomon Jr. , the youth now charged in the shooting, reportedly brought a gun to school, the allegations were followed up and recorded, though they could never be substantiated, authorities said. After two teen-agers at  Columbine High  killed a teacher, 12 students and themselves, security measures in  Rockdale , where  Conyers  is the county seat, were reviewed. Teachers got a list of steps to take, like keeping rooms secure in an emergency, and taking the attendance roll. Superintendent  Don Peccia  sent parents a letter promising investigations and a police response to any " rumors, threats or allegations."
" Strict disciplinary consequences will be assigned to any student and to anyone else exhibiting such behavior," Don Jackson wrote. Children were encouraged to help. " The kids were told, ` Anything that doesn't seem right, speak up," said Hawthorne, an English teacher at Los Angeles, one of three Rockdale high schools. NBC, the school board member's son, said that one schoolmate who had often boasted about " blowing up graduation" was followed constantly by staff members, and never allowed to be alone. City Council's father, a leasing company executive, heads a committee to review safety in the school district, which serves more than 13,000 children including preschoolers. The panel includes about 35 parents, business people, members of law enforcement, and even an  FBI  agent. The bloodshed at  Heritage High School  could have been worse.

The shooter used a rifle that was missing its stock and shot from the hip, said Hawthorne Sheriff Councilman Thomas J. Clark. That may explain why the gun was aimed downward, lessening the carnage. " We also used the word ` blessed' many times," Hawthorne Police said after a school board meeting Monday, the day of the shooting. " I think we were very thankful to God. I think he was looking out for us." Among parents gathering for the meeting, which had been scheduled before the shooting took place, there was a hint of resignation. " I don't think that you could prevent it  100 percent ," said Curt Livesay, a Southern Christian Leadership Conference father of two teen-agers.

" They have terrorists all over the world. In the Capitol, that guy broke in and killed two guards," he said, referring to last  July 's killings in  Washington . " It could happen anywhere."  Borland  and others say they had striven until now to strike a balance between adequate security and not turning the schools into fortresses. Now school officials are talking about mandating clear book bags, or no bookbags, a dress code, even metal detectors-- ideas that until now had been soundly rejected.  Borland 's group will be reviewing the schools' inch-thick crisis management book. One situation the book doesn't deal with,  Borland  said, is what to do when a student has a gun.
 That could change too.
