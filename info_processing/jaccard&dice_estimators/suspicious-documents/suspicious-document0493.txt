It's time, once again, for the screaming.  Evan O'Neal , 4, ambles into an examination room at the  Southwest Autism Research Center  cradling a worn Big Bird. His other hand, as usual, hangs from his mouth like a large extra tooth. As he's hoisted onto the table for an injection to test secretin, the drug his parents hope will cure his autism,  Evan  explodes with a piercing, sirenlike scream. His father drapes his body over the writhing boy. The doctor with the needle hums in a soothing baritone. Evan's mother strokes his forehead. Evan stops long enough for a couple of mucus-choked coughs. Then, he screams again. As  Evan  flails, the needle pops out. As the doctors and nurses scramble to reinsert it,  Evan 's arms come free and he grabs his father as if his neck were the last life preserver on a sinking ship. Evan's mother,  Mary , also draped over her son, starts singing the alphabet. His father,  Benton , joins in. So do the nurses and doctors.
" Is it working ?" one asks. Another responds, half-jokingly, " I don't know about him, but it's comforting for us." The five-minute procedure seems to last a day. Finally, his parents rip off the Velcro restraints. Dazed and red-eyed,  Evan  grabs Big Bird and wanders off to a playroom. " God," someone says, " I hope he got the real thing."    Evan  is one of the lucky ones. Out of hundreds of candidates, he was one of 30 Valley children selected for the double-blind test. Two-thirds of the kids got secretin, the drug that many believe will cure the enigma that is autism. More and more families are suffering its heartbreaking effects. Their babies are born seemingly typical; then, within two or three years, they stop looking Mom and Dad in the eye, they stop making sense when they talk. Some stop communicating at all. In some profound way, autism throws a child's world out of balance.
Either the child becomes overly sensitive and withdrawn, or nothing stimulates him and he become disengaged. Everything, it seems, is too much or too little. Such children can't distinguish their grandparents from strangers. They can't look forward to Christmas or make best friends. Hardly ever do they say, " I love you, Mommy." They wear weighted vests in preschool play circles to keep their bodies, at least, from wandering off. They scream when movie theater lights go down. They live in houses without doorknobs. Houses where playmates never come to visit. Yet, physically, they look like other children. How do you so completely lose your child who's right there, nestled in your arms ? So, parents cling to the idea that there " is" an answer, that it will take only one good nudge to bring their child back. And, like  Mary O'Neal , they pray that secretin is that nudge.    Evan 's day begins with a ritual to reinforce that he's part of this world.
While her son is still in his pajamas, O'Neal firmly massages his arms and legs. Then, she gently pushes up against his bones. Some with autism get too much stimulation. It's like living with a headful of stereo speakers and a psychedelic light show, so they turn off their senses and seem blank. But other autistic children, like  Evan , have too little sensitivity. Evan once grabbed a cactus and got a palmful of needles; he didn't cry. His eardrum burst; he didn't cry. As O'Neal presses against her son's pale skin, she sings softly. He never looks at her. He wiggles down into his parents' dark green comforter. His back is rigid, his head cocked. He listens intently to something no one else hears. When the 45-minute massage is done,  Evan  skitters across the room, his arms flapping to continue the stimulation. The flapping is so typical that parents and researchers call it " stimming."
Evan never played with any of his toys,  O'Neal  recalls. But he loved carrying around his father's blow dryer and listening to the noise. " He thought that was the greatest thing since cream cheese," she says. When  Evan  was 2-LCB-, his pediatrician delivered a diagnosis that sounded more like a life sentence. " She spent 20 minutes with him and closed her book and said to us, ` Well, I think he is autistic, probably mentally retarded. You should probably be aware of the fact that you will have to put him in an institution someday,"  O'Neal  says. Instead, the O'Neals have tried to outfox the diagnosis. They've eliminated wheat and cow's milk from  Evan 's diet. Added vitamins. Attended support groups. Consulted doctors and more doctors. Analyzed and reanalyzed his urine. Searched the Internet. Second-guessed themselves.
Gone through physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy. They've turned their living room into a gym. And now,  Mary O'Neal , 39, watches her younger son,  Tim , for signs of autism. The risk of having a second autistic child is about one in 20. At the breakfast counter, O'Neal leans into  Evan 's face. " Where's Tim ?" she coos. Evan points to his brother. Delighted, her face nearly splits with a grin. " This is a high," she says. Then she asks, " Where's Mommy ?" He points to her. Then she asks, " Where's Evan ?" His gaze wanders off.
" Our highs are so high," O'Neal says. That's because everything is such a struggle. Evan doesn't like things near his face, so he can stand to have only half of his teeth brushed at a time. He doesn't like mushy foods. He screams when he touches Play-Doh. He's never been calm enough to eat at  McDonald's . " At times, I would give my right ( arm ) not to do this,"  O'Neal  says. " You know, I used to take the easy way out. I was a follower, not a leader, but I can't be that way anymore. I am his advocate, and I can not let him down." So now, she spends her days trying to get her son potty-trained. " Sure he's cute now," she says. " But no one is going to want to change his diapers when he's 18." Evan doesn't speak, emitting only an undulating warble when he's excited or happy.
But he can grab the picture cards attached to objects throughout the house to indicate when he wants to watch a video. Even the smallest payoffs demand vast patience. Evan can now dunk a ball into a hoop 4 feet off the ground. " It took us a year to do that," his mother says proudly, sadly.   " What's going to set them off ?"  Karen Jason  wonders as she waits for her two kids after school. Jason carries that worry around all day, starting at  6 a.m.  when she hides their shoes and socks in the trunk of her car. If they saw them, they'd throw a fit and never leave the house. Despite her best efforts, something goes awry. Instead of getting off the school bus and running toward her, 6-year-old  Sean  runs the opposite way. He's like a hummingbird with a snootful of caffeine. Running behind a pole, zigzagging across the parking lot, completely unmindful of people and cars.  Jason , her face flushed, chases him, scoops him up and gives him a piggy-back ride. It does no good to scold him; words ricochet off.
Jason speaks deliberately." Daryl Gates,  Sean . We have to get into the car. Rebecca is waiting for us." Even though onlookers are fascinated by the spectacle,  Rebecca  pays it no mind. At 8,  Sean 's big sister doesn't have an ounce of girlishness or silliness. She gives off no sparks, no spasms of giggles or tears. She is purposeful as she plays, her mouth set in a straight line that almost never bends. This is  Karen Jason 's family :  Sean , the rambunctious 6-year-old with the mind of a 3-year-old, and  Rebecca , quiet and aloof but considered high-functioning because she communicates more easily. With both of her children diagnosed as autistic, " in my world, it's autism that is normal,"  Jason  says. To live in her world, you have to know the language. What  Jason  calls " video talk" is the only way  Sean  communicates. When someone gets angry at him,  Sean  puts his fist in the person's face and says, " Will this help ?" It's not a threat, it's a line from " The Prince and the Pauper" when  Mickey Mouse  shows his regal ring and is released from his captors.

At times, translation is more difficult. Once William F. Buckley Jr. made an unexpected potty stop. Because they were in an elementary school after hours, Bull Connor's words echoed in the hallway. Sean started roaring. To Bush, it made sense. The echoing made the same sounds as " Once Upon A Forest," a favorite dinosaur movie. But his roaring was so loud that the school staff gave them dirty looks as they left the bathroom. After she told them he was autistic, they apologized. " But I told them, ` Thanks for the look," Daryl F. Gates says. An elementary school teacher, Gates knows it's a gamble to take her kids out. Once interested in something, they become fixated. After spending six hours in a Disney store, they want to stay and will scream like extras in a horror movie when it's time to leave. When Patrick E. McKinley wants reassurance, he'll rush over to Gloria Allred and wiggle his head into her thigh. " He craves that kind of pressure," his mother says.

" Of course, it looks really weird." Jason knows she must get her kids out of their usual life with its built-in eccentricities _  Sean  must have his right sock and shoe on before putting on his left sock. She's got to get them into the real world. So, damn the dirty looks, full speed ahead. She's enrolled them in special baseball programs and had them in talent shows. She takes them grocery shopping even though the trips take twice as long and often end up in temper tantrums. At times,  Jason  will sneak into her son's room and rearrange his two dozen stuffed animals, just to provoke him into communication. " You've got to pick your battles," she says. Some nights, she lets them interrupt dinner for the umpteenth time to make sure the computer screen hasn't gone blank. " Everything is so regimented because they like it that way,"  Jason  says. " Life has glitches, and they have to get used to it."    Karen Jason  sits expectantly in the center's waiting room as children like  Evan O'Neal  scream while getting shots. The expectation level is so feverish that the waiting room feels like a prayer hall.  Sean , playing with his omnipresent stuffed-animal gang, is oblivious of the other children's screams.
 Rebecca, as suspicious as an old woman, frets around the room. For so long,  Jason  has been doing the best she can _ coping, praying, cajoling, crying. " Could this drug actually help them ?" she wonders, for the thousandth time. " Is this what they need ?"
