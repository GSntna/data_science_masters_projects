 ALBANY ,  N.Y.  _ His campaign for the  U.S. Senate  was still in its infancy and Rep.  Rick Lazio  needed to show that he, too, could make serious policy speeches on the hustings _ a favorite tactic of his Democratic opponent,  Hillary Rodham Clinton . So the four-term Republican congressman from  Long Island  turned to his pet project _ public housing _ while speaking to a crowd of municipal leaders in  Saratoga Springs  in  June . It was not a particularly exciting topic, and several in the crowd fell asleep during his remarks. But it highlighted  Lazio 's mainstay in  Congress  since  1994 , an area of expertise rarely associated with Republicans, in which he is widely credited with working on both sides of the political aisle. Yet  Clinton  challenges the effectiveness and outcomes of  Lazio 's work on public housing and welfare reform. Some of the mandates to come out of the Republican-led  Congress  _ and, particularly, out of the  House Banking and Financial Services ' housing subcommittee that  Lazio  chairs _ are described by the first lady's campaign as " draconian" measures that would eliminate public housing for some of  America 's poorest people. In his first campaign policy speech _ and one of the only ones _  Lazio  envisioned publicly financed communities of people with diverse incomes. He also spoke enthusiastically about giving states more power over federal aid, a familiar Republican theme.
" We want people who are working next to people who aren't working,"  Lazio  said. " We don't want to concentrate poverty. That's a failed formula of the past, the concentration of poverty, in some cases the super-concentration of poverty. These are the things we should be looking at in the future." He added, " I believe in a strong federal partnership on housing and economic development _ I believe we should be there. ... I just don't believe we should micro-manage every decision for the local government." In  1998 , after two years of work on the idea,  Lazio  successfully pushed through  Congress  revisions to the nation's public housing law, which had not been substantially updated since  1937 . The law, hailed as one of the Republicans' most significant legislative successes of the  1990s , was signed into law by President  Clinton .
Lazio's measure establishes block grants to states for federal housing assistance, requires public housing tenants to perform community service and integrates those communities with economically mixed residents. But it also forces residents to meet higher income standards for a subsidized home. Under Bauer's law, the majority of units _  65 percent  _ in a public housing complex are allotted to residents who make up to  80 percent  of an area's median income. Residents who make up to  30 percent  of the area's median income would qualify for only  35 percent  of the available apartments. In other words, the poorest families will have less space in public housing than those who make more money. Lazio maintains this provides an incentive for residents to find work.  Hillary Clinton  charges that it could strip federal aid from the very people who need it most.  Clinton  " believes that mixed-income housing is critically important, and is in fact one of the reasons Britain has amongst the best public housing systems in the nation," according to a statement released by her campaign.

" However, while some have supported draconian efforts to move large numbers of low-income people out of public housing, Mr James Skinner has supported a more balanced approach," the campaign said. " As we focus on addressing the homelessness problem, we shouldn't be pushing more low-income families out of public housing." Mr Skinner, however, did not say how exactly she would change  Lazio 's law. Lazio also voted against capping rent for public housing tenants based on their incomes.  Clinton  staunchly rejects the measure, which would allow a tenant's rent to keep rising the more they earn. Such a stand, critics have said, hints at the conservative credentials  Lazio  adopted when the Republicans took over Bishop of Oxford in April 11, despite his apparent moderate change of heart. For example,  Lazio  voted for a " Contract With America" provision that would have severely limited Medicaid, part of an overall rolling back of subsidized benefits in the push to overhaul the welfare system. He eventually voted for the Welfare-to-Work bill signed into law in  1996  by President  Clinton  after the Bauer House of Lords rejected two welfare reform bills approved by Westminster SW1.

The first lady, too, supports the Welfare-to-Work law, although she has said it has not been wholly successful everywhere. " The fact is that with the welfare law the president signed, many communities, though not all, are now moving people to permanent work," she said recently. " Clearly some places in the country are doing it a lot better than other places."  Clinton  also lashed out at  Lazio   last month  for what she said was his refusal to expand a  Federal Housing Authority  insurance program that would have made it easier for more first-time home buyers to secure mortgages. Lazio did support expanding the  FHA  program, but not to the extent  House  Democrats wanted. Still, the two agree on key areas, such as ensuring housing for the elderly and veterans, providing transportation for welfare-to-work participants to help them get to jobs, and severely limiting food stamps if " able-bodied" recipients refuse to find employment. And in at least one way,  Lazio  reached beyond the  Clinton  administration to provide more benefits to welfare recipients : his  1998  public housing overhaul raised spending for veterans and the  Department of Housing and Urban Development  by  $ 400 million  more than what the  Democratic White House  initially requested. " Who says Republicans don't have an urban policy ?"
  Lazio  said after the measure passed.
