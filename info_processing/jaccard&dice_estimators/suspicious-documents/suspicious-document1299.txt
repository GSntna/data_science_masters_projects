Some natural remedies can ease the pain of arthritis. Others just ease the money out of your wallet. Here's what you need to know to be a wise _ and safe _ consumer. Shark cartilage. Glucosamine. Chondroitin. You've undoubtedly heard of them. They're all touted to help _ if not " cure" _ arthritis. But do they work ? Some do, some don't. Americans spend an estimated  $ 10 billion  a year on unproven _ and ineffective _ arthritis remedies. This guide will help you choose the right natural remedy to ease your pain _ and at the right price too. Here is an overview of supplements, what they claim to do, any proof related thereto, suggested use and cost.  GLUCOSAMINE SULFATE   Claim : Glucosamine, a natural substance, furnishes the building blocks that our bodies use to make and repair cartilage. Proof : Some recent well-done research shows that glucosamine soothes knee pain as well as ibuprofen does, but without the side effects.
Suggested Dose : 1,500 milligrams ( mg ) a day in two or three doses. Some Prices We Found :  GNC  : Thirty 600-mg capsules,  $ 7.99 . Nature's Bounty : Thirty 500-mg capsules,  $ 10.89   CHONDROITIN SULFATE   Claim : Experts think that chondroitin, which exists naturally in cartilage, may make tissue more flexible and protect it from harmful chemicals. Proof : Some studies show that chondroitin stops joint degeneration, improves joint function and eases pain. But evidence is stronger for glucosamine. Suggested Dose : 1,200 mg a day in two or three doses. (  May  increase the effects of blood-thinning drugs and herbs. ) Some Prices We Found :  Twinlab  : Thirty 750-mg capsules,  $ 17.09 . Basic Nutrition : Thirty 400-mg capsules,  $ 9.99 . GNC : Thirty 400-mg capsules,  $ 18.49 .  GLUCOSAMINE AND CHONDROITIN   Claim : The combined effects of these supplements may help ease osteoarthritis ( OA ) symptoms. Proof : A recent study showed that after eight weeks of taking both supplements (  Cosamin  ), men with OA reported less knee pain. Suggested Dose : 500 mg of glucosamine and 400 mg of chondroitin in three doses. It may take up to eight weeks to see improvement. Some Prices We Found :  Cosamin  DS : 180 capsules,  $ 84.99  to  $ 94.99 .
 SAM-e / or S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE   Claim :  May  improve joint mobility and relieve the pain of OA by boosting levels of the amino acid  ATP  and supporting cartilage production. Proof : Some studies have shown that SAM-e relieves mild OA pain almost as well as NSAIDs, but without the digestive tract side effects. Suggested Dose : 200 to 400 mg in three doses. Some Prices We Found :  GNC  : Thirty 200-mg tablets,  $ 39.99 . Nature Made : Twenty 200-mg tablets,  $ 21.99 .  FISH OIL   Claim : The omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil _ eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) _ may ease rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) symptoms by providing anti-inflammatory building blocks. Proof : Many studies have shown that fish oil helps the inflammation and accompanying pain of RA. It may reduce the need for NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. Suggested Dose : 3 grams ( g ) or 3,000 mg a day total of EPA/DHA. Good food sources are cold-water fish such as sardines, salmon, tuna and mackerel. Try to eat them two or three times a week. Some Prices We Found : Nature's Way : Max  EPA , 100 capsules ( 120 mg  DHA  and 180 mg  EPA  each ),  $ 10.39 . Twinlab : Twin  EPA  Extra Strength, 60 capsules ( 240 mg  DHA  and 600 mg  EPA  each ),  $ 27.95 .  GLA ( GAMMA LINOLENIC ACID )   Claim : The body converts these omega-6 fatty acids into anti-inflammatory compounds. Proof : Studies show that  GLA  can reduce the tenderness, morning stiffness and inflammation of RA.
It may reduce the need for NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. Suggested Dose : 1,800 mg a day. GLA is available in evening primrose oil ( may counteract the effects of anticonvulsant drugs ), borage oil and black currant seed oil. Some Prices We Found :  Twinlab  : Ultra GLA 300, Thirty 300-mg softgels,  $ 11.89 .  GREEN TEA   Claim : Polyphenols in green tea have been shown to reduce inflammation, a symptom of RA. Proof : Mice given green tea extract had much lower rates of arthritis than mice not given the extract. Human studies are needed, but green tea is safe, so it may be worth a try. Suggested Dose : 3 to 4 cups a day ( equivalent of 600 to 800 mg of polyphenols ). It's also available in decaffeinated and flavored forms and capsules. If you buy decaffeinated tea, it must be decaffeinated using water and carbon dioxide, a process called effervescence, in order to retain the polyphenols. If the label doesn't tell you, contact the manufacturer. Some Prices We Found :  GNC  : Star GLA Omega-3 Gamma-Linolenic Acid, Sixty 200-mg softgel capsules,  $ 29.99 . Alvita : Green Tea bulk ( note : milk may interfere with the polyphenol's action, so drink green tea plain ), 4.5 ounces,  $ 3.99 . GNC :  Chinese Harvest of Nature Green Tea , 24 bags,  $ 4.99 .  Natrol  : Sixty 500-mg capsules,  $ 8.29   TYPE II COLLAGEN   Claim : Suppresses the autoimmune response that causes the pain, swelling, and stiffness of RA.
Meteorologists often attribute the 1988 drought in North America to the northward displacement of the jet stream, which similarly displaced northward the storms that track along its path. However, researchers from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Camp Springs, Md. say that what we should know is why the jet stream was displaced northward. They say the shift was caused by temperature abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific. If their computer models hold true and such weather abnormalities can be predicted, then perhaps we can also predict droughts.

Proof : Some studies show that taking type II collagen orally can reduce the pain and inflammation of RA. Suggested Dose : 500 micrograms ( mcg ) or less. NSAIDs may block the absorption of type II collagen; talk to your doctor before using. Some Prices We Found : National Center for Atmospheric Research : Maxilife chicken collagen, 60 pills,  $ 25.95 .  OPTIONAL SIDEBAR : SAVE YOUR MONEY   The pain and chronic nature of arthritis force some people to try almost anything for relief, even unproven _ or downright harmful _ remedies. When in doubt, ask your doctor for guidance. In the meantime, here are a few products that have not been proven to relieve arthritis _ though some have benefits for other conditions : _ Copper bracelets : There's no scientific evidence to back up copper's antiarthritis claims. _ Shark cartilage : Although advertised to help ease osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, there is no scientifically accepted evidence that shark cartilage works for arthritis. _ Alfalfa : Used for years as a folk remedy for arthritis, no studies show that it's effective. _ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( dimethyl sulfoxide ) : A byproduct of wood processing,  DMSO  is said to ease pain and improve flexibility in people with arthritis. But many versions on the market aren't suitable for humans. They're chemically impure and potentially harmful. _ Maybe  MSM  ? There is some anecdotal evidence that  MSM  ( methyl sulfonyl methane ) may help alleviate arthritis pain. So far, no published studies have shown that it's effective for treating arthritis.

But if you haven't had success with any of the proven arthritis remedies, it's probably safe to try National Center for Atmospheric Research to see if it helps you.  OPTIONAL SIDEBAR : SHOP SMART   With so many arthritis supplements on the market, it's hard to know what to buy and what to avoid. Our 10-point checklist will help.1. Make sure that the product label lists the amount of the active ingredient it contains.2. Choose products from large companies _ they value their reputations.3. Buy supplements at stores you trust.4. Avoid products using words such as " scientific breakthrough" or " miracle cure." 5. Beware of products that claim to cure all types of arthritis.6. Remember : If a product sounds too good to be true, it probably is.7. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplement for arthritis.8. Continue taking your current medication until you've gotten your doctor's OK to try something new.9. Bear in mind that " natural" doesn't necessarily mean safe.10. If you already take an arthritis supplement, mention it to your doctor.  OPTIONAL SIDEBAR : ANTIOXIDANTS FOR ARTHRITIS   Need another reason to get your five-a-day ?

Some studies have shown that the antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables may protect joints _ especially the knee _ from the ravages of osteoarthritis ( OA ). Here are a few of the studies' findings : _ People with high intakes of vitamin C and beta-carotene had a reduced risk of knee pain and disease progression. _ Certain antioxidants ( including lutein and lycopene, among others ) were associated with lower risk of knee OA. _ Vitamin E eased arthritis pain better than a placebo or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ). To be sure that you're getting enough beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene and vitamin C, eat lots of carrots, sweet potatoes, broccoli, spinach, tomato sauce and tomato juice, oranges, kiwifruit and strawberries. ( Prevention now recommends nine veggies a day for disease protection. ) To get the amount of vitamin E that most experts advise, you'll need a vitamin E supplement containing 400 international units. Since OA progression was three times higher in people with low levels of vitamin D, it's best to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement with  100 percent  of the daily value for D.
