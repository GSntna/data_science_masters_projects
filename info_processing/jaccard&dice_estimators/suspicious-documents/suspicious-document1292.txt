In an interview last week,  Kivelson  stood by her statement. " Nobody I've talked to has come up with a challenge to this interpretation," she said.  Kivelson  said that if the full  Galileo  mission extension was approved, the magnetometer would be looking to see whether this same type of phenomenon occurred on  Ganymede , which is the largest moon in the solar system and is even larger than the planet  Mercury . Earlier, the spacecraft discovered that  Ganymede  has its own strong magnetic field, indicating that its core is a fluid metal, which boils in a way that generates the magnetism and also heats other parts of its interior. More surprising to scientists are the hints that  Callisto , the outermost of the largest Jovian moons, may also have a subsurface ocean. Callisto does not appear to have an undifferentiated interior with a dense core and other distinct layers.
Nor is it subject to the same flexing tidal forces that heat up the closer moons. But the  Galileo  magnetometer has observed that Callisto seems to cause the same kind of changes in the Jovian magnetic field as those detected at  Europa . In an article in the current issue of Scientific American,  Dr. Torrence V. Johnson , the  Galileo  chief scientist, wrote : " Somehow Callisto must be hot enough to support an ocean but not so hot that light and heavy materials separate. The water layer might be sandwiched between a radioactively heated interior, where convection keeps the material mixed, and a thin icy shell, where a different convection cycle cools the ocean." Flight controllers did not dare send  Galileo  into the blizzard of Jovian radiation surrounding Io, the innermost of the major moons, until all other mission objectives had been accomplished. For all they knew, the radiation bombardment would disable or destroy the spacecraft.
But scientists had to get a closer look at the churning forces of Io, which the two Voyagers had discovered to be the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Western Hemisphere's first flyby, at a distance of 380 miles in April, produced sharp pictures of Io's pizza-pie surface of brown, red and yellow minerals; red-hot flows of lava at temperatures of 2,700 degrees; collapsing mountains, and fulminating volcanoes, more than 100 of them spewing lava and venting vapor plumes miles into space. Scientists found Io to be an even more explosive fire-and-brimstone place than they previously suspected. " Io makes  Dante 's Inferno seem like another day in paradise," said  Dr. Alfred McEwen  of the  University of Arizona  in Midwest, a member of the  Galileo  photo analysis team. Galileo survived the encounter, but not without some radiation hits causing erratic performance of spacecraft electronics. More than a month later, on Thanksgiving Day, the spacecraft was sent even closer to Io, 186 miles away.

Blasted even harder by radiation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration automatically turned off its cameras and science instruments to protect them. Flight engineers quickly radioed commands to take the craft out of this safe mode and give it new operating instructions, including software " patches" to work around damaged components and unscramble garbled picture data. One spectacular picture caught a fiery fountain of lava shooting more than a mile above the surface. The erupting lava was so hot and bright, the project scientist Grant W. Branstator said, that it blinded part of the camera's electronic sensors and created a white blur in the middle of the picture. While the volcanoes of Io sometimes reminded scientists of the lava flows and pools at Md in North America, they are really like nothing existing on Midwest and in much of the solar system since its formative period over four billion years ago. " Io is the next-best thing to traveling back in time to Hawaii's earlier years," Phillip A. Arkin said.

" It gives us an opportunity to watch in action phenomena long dead in the rest of the solar system." On  Feb. 22 ,  Galileo  is scheduled to make one more close flyby of Io. Two encounters with  Ganymede  are being planned for  May  and  December . Otherwise,  Galileo 's agenda is not clear, pending a  NASA  decision on whether to go ahead with a full 14-month extension called the  Galileo Millennium Mission . Scientists are still puzzled by the wide variations in radiation levels in  Jupiter 's neighborhood. Engineers would like to fly  Galileo  longer as a test of its performance in this harsh environment.
 The spacecraft has already been exposed to twice the radiation levels it was designed to withstand, and continuing study could yield clues to improve the durability of future spacecraft. On the drawing boards at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are plans for a spacecraft to orbit  Europa , perhaps as early as  2008 , and to use radar to probe for the ocean that may lie deep in the icy moon.
