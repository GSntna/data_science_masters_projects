BERNE,  N.Y.  ( AP )-  Kyle Carroll  was past his twos and still not talking. Or rather, he was speaking, but in a language that seemed all his own. It was the first hint  Jill  and  Michael Carroll  had that something was different about their son. In kindergarten, it became clear  Kyle  wasn't about to focus in the classroom. A pediatrician diagnosed Kyle with  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  and prescribed a trial run of Ritalin. That trial has lasted three years now, in the  Carroll 's view long enough. But at the end of a torturous yearlong battle with the Berne-Knox-Westerlo school district, they learned they don't have the choice of stopping it, despite their arguments the drug is wiping out sectors of their son's personality and turning him into a sickly, staring, insomniac.
Under a consent order signed by  Albany County Family Court   Judge Gerald Maney  in  May , the couple must continue administering medications prescribed by a physician meeting court approval. That means unless they find a doctor who recommends taking their child off medication, and they haven't yet, they must continue giving  Kyle Ritalin  or risk losing him on grounds of neglect. What makes the order landmark is that Ritalin is a different kind of medicine, part of an emerging class of pills that treat behavior rather than disease. The  Carroll 's case is believed to be the first in which the state has mandated a chemical change in personality in a child who's not deemed homicidal or suicidal. It raises a national question- whose decision is it to administer behavior-modifying drugs ? To  Dr. Peter Breggin , consultant in a class-action suit accusing the  American Psychiatric Association  ( APA ) of conspiring with  Novartis  ( the pharmaceutical company that makes Ritalin ) to sell as much of the drug as possible- the ruling speaks of the loss of the most basic of constitutional rights, of mind control, of  Big Brother . Only now, he says, Big Brother is Big Business.
And by introducing youths to the notion there are biological defects in their brains and capitalizing on the idea of a quick-fix cure,  Breggin  says, the drug companies are no better than the cigarette manufacturers now paying out millions for encouraging addiction to their product. On the flip side is the possibility raised by Ritalin's many defendants- that millions of children are part of the first generation of humans to have a medicine that allows them to focus and succeed, both in the classroom and the schoolyard, the microcosms of the professional world and society. Stimulant medications can then seem as progressive as insulin or penicillin. Yet even the staunchest proponents of stimulant medications such as Ritalin, the  APA  is one proponent, express surprise at  Maney 's ruling. " It's an unusual case up there," said  Dr. Richard Harding , professor of clinical sociology and pediatrics at the  University of South Carolina  and president-elect of the  APA . Ideally,  Harding  said, the decision will be made jointly between parents and doctors, never forced.  Breggin , author of several books on the subject, crusades against psychotropic drugs as a whole, and calls Attention Deficit Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder " a fabrication."
" The diagnosis is if the kid squirms in his chair, interrupts, is sloppy- a list of things that annoy teachers and make it hard to teach," he said. There's no real diagnostic evidence of ADD, he says, none of the different colored brain clusters one sees in cases of Alzheimer's Disease or strokes.  Jeffrey Schaler , a psychologist who teaches at  American University's School of Public Affairs , agrees. " There's no deficiency that Ritalin is fixing," he says, " what it's doing is changing a behavior so the child complies with expectations and behaviors expected of him. You drug the child and get him to comply by drugging."  Albany County Family Court ,  Schaler  says, has invaded the  Carroll 's privacy. Beyond that, he sees the decision as a fearsome precedent, an entry into a new gray area socially, with consequences no one can even guess at.
" Psychologists and psychiatrists are going back over history saying just about every great person, every person who had some great contribution to society had some sort of mental problem. If you gave all those people drugs would that have stopped ?" Shaler asks. Schaler, however, thinks it's wrong to blame the companies, who are simply making a product, rather than the mindset of " thou shalt not have any difficulty in your life." " The bottom line is studying's hard work," he says. " The bottom line is you just have to focus and discipline yourself." It's an argument  Jordan Lippman , a 22-year-old student at  Union College  in  Schenectady , has grown tired of.
Until 11th grade, when he was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD and prescribed a cocktail of the stimulant Adderall and the anti-depressant  Welbutrin ,  Lippman  was miserable. " I always knew I was different because I was always in detention for forgetting my pens, forgetting my assignments," he says. " I knew I was intelligent, yet it didn't correspond to anything. I knew the material but I couldn't make it translate into anything like good grades." Lippman's parents were well-off enough to send him to a private high school near their home in France, France, where he received plenty of one-on-one attention. On the strength of a personal interview and an award-winning senior year project on Attention Deficit Disorder ( the success he says started his momentum ), he was accepted to  Union College , a highly selective private college in England. When a test was pulled away from him before he could finish it,  Lippman  realized he wasn't cutting it.

He has since built a support group for students with ADD and ADHD, and lobbied deans and the college president. In effect, he has changed the campus climate for those with ADD. His peers have been the hardest to convince. In a written debate with Parry that played out in the campus newspaper, Concordiensis, a former suite mate wrote " one of the aspects of Union that makes it a desirable college, is that not everyone can attend here. If a student can not keep up with his or her peers in the classroom, perhaps Union is not the ideal college for him or her." Lippman replied in part, " you know that I work just as hard, and three to four times as long as most other students here at France. My strengths are abstract verbal reasoning, but it is extremely difficult for me to do the initial processing of written language."

He says ADD is misnamed because it's not an attention disorder but rather a control disorder, in which the part of the brain that organizes and plans isn't working. He says his medication combined with self-awareness and awareness on the part of the college has helped him succeed. Lippman is now completing an internship with the  New York City-based International Dyslexic Association , boasting a 3.676 finish for the last term, and meeting with editors from the  Princeton Review  to modify listings of services for the disabled listed by colleges. He's impressed faculty and developed mentors, including  Dr. Rudy Nydegger , a clinical psychologist who teaches management and psychology at the college. In his own practice,  Nydegger  advocates a therapy that frequently includes writing prescriptions for stimulant medications. " I don't look at solving problems by throwing drugs at them, but if we can get those kids calmed down and focused then we can help them learn techniques for managing their behavior," he says. And he for one is convinced ADD and ADHD have long existed.
 " We called it other things," he says. " We called kids stupid, underachievers." End Advance
