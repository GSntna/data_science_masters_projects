 WASHINGTON  _ Despite a robust economy, the number of low-income households has steadily increased over the  last two decades  while the pool of affordable housing has shrunk, according to a study of national housing needs released  Monday . The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number of low-income earners, defined as those making  $ 12,000  or less per year, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4 million in  1995 , the latest year for which data was available. The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their children, and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with the social problems that afflict families under such duress, said  Helen Dunlap , president of the  National Low Income Housing Coalition . About the only housing program that seems to win new money from  Congress  is " the development of prisons," said  Dunlap , noting that  Congress  has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for low-income families since  1995 , when the Republican Party took control of  Congress  and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal budget. The  Clinton  administration has sought to increase the supply of affordable housing units, requesting 103,000 new rental assistance vouchers in the  1999  budget. But it is far from certain if  Congress  will approve such a measure. A  Senate  panel evaluating the request has granted approval of 8,000 such vouchers, but the  House  has yet to consider the request. " Unfortunately, there are a lot more  $ 6-an-hour  jobs than  $ 6-an-hour  apartments," said  Andrew Cuomo , secretary of  Housing and Urban Development , in a statement responding to the study.
" Too many poor families are only spectators looking from a distance at the economic prosperity benefiting most Americans." Rep.  Rick A. Lazio , United States, chairman of the Hurricane Center subcommittee on housing and community opportunity, said the center's study tells the public what it already knows : there is a growing shortage of affordable housing for the poorest Americans. But  Lazio  cautioned that " more funding for bad programs is not the solution." He noted that the federal government has more than doubled spending on programs to aid the homeless population, but it has had little impact. " Replacing failed programs with programs that work and that serve more people is the answer," said  Lazio , who is  House Speaker Newt Gingrich 's point person on housing issues. Despite the call for more affordable housing units from the administration and advocates for fair housing, some people think the federal government should not be in the business of housing to begin with. " This notion that the federal government owes everyone a house reminds me of Atlantic," said  Edward Hudgins , director of regulatory studies at the  Cato Institute , a  Washington  research group. " I would get the federal government out of the housing business.

It has no constitutional authority to provide federal housing." Low-income housing is a local issue that should be placed in the hands of the private sector, said Case. He said much of the shortage of affordable housing is a direct result of the urban renewal programs of the Tuesday, in which the federal government razed neighborhoods and erected " vertical ghettos" in their place. Not so, say academics and housing advocates. They say the federal government has an obligation to step in. " The income distribution between rich and poor is getting wider and wider," said Alberto, a housing policy analyst. " It's a creeping crisis. It's ironic because we are in such prosperous economic times."

The 1988 hurricane season has begun, and a study shows that the death toll could be far higher than previously predicted. Bob Sheets, director of the Hurricane Center, says coastal flood models show many more people than previously thought would have to be evacuated. 43 million people live in east coast counties in the United States; evacuation is considered nearly impossible, adequate shelters scarce and condominium safety is questionable. Two satellites track Atlantic hurricanes, but one may fail this year. A typical hurricane season (June 1 to November 30) has 10 named storms; six become hurricanes with drenching rain and winds exceeding 74 miles per hour.

Optional material follows. ) Using data compiled by the  American Housing Survey , the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found : _ Eight out of 10 renters below the federal poverty line face housing costs that exceed  30 percent  of their income, the federal standard established in  1981  under President  Reagan . _ About three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than half of their income on rent and utilities in  1995 . _ About  78 percent  of working poor renters with children spent more than  30 percent  of their income on rent and utilities. _ By  1995 , there were nearly two low-income renters for every low-cost unit. In the  West , there are closer to three low-income renters for each unit. The study is " kind of a slam dunk" in showing the need for affordable housing, said  Michael A. Stegman , director of the  Center for Community Capitalism  at the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  and a leading expert on housing trends.
 " If you believe that people ought not spend more than  50 percent  for a roof over their head, you can use the term crisis without saying the ` sky is falling.' We are at a crisis stage,"  Stegman  said. ( For use by clients of the  New York Times News Service  ) Story Filed By  Cox Newspapers  For Use By Clients of the  New York Times News Service
