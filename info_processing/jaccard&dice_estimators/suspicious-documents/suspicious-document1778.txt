 MOSCOW  _ An energetic-looking President-elect  Vladimir Putin  arrived at work  Monday  to meet with government leaders, but instead of triumphant speeches about his election victory,  Putin  shed no light about which way he'll lead the economy and society. " The level of expectations is very high. People are tired and struggling and they're hoping for things to get better, but miracles don't happen," he said. " A lot of things that will lead to many controversies need to be done." With  96 percent  of the vote counted, Russian election officials named  Putin , 47, the winner of only the second democratic presidential election in  Russia 's history with  53 percent . Communist Party leader  Gennady Zyuganov  finished in second place with a stronger-than-expected  29 percent , and liberal  Gregory Yavlinsky  was third with  6 percent . Although  Putin 's victory has been expected since former President  Boris Yeltsin 's abrupt resignation on  Dec. 31 , the novice politician appeared unprepared with the first tough tasks of office, namely nominating a new prime minister and Cabinet.
Putin's chief of staff,  Dmitry Kozak , said  Putin  would wait to publish his economic plan and list of ministerial candidates until after his inauguration, which the Information Ministry tentatively scheduled for March. Putin can not officially call himself president until that time. Putin gave no hints  Monday  as to who he favors to head his new government, saying only that cooperation is needed from all political parties and that the results of the elections will have to figure into his decision making. Analysts said this signalled  Putin 's willingness to make room for political opposition in the new government, especially the Communists, with whom  Putin 's parliamentary bloc already has a strategic alliance in the Communist Party, the lower house of parliament. Yet even as  Putin  extended an olive branch to his rivals,  Zyuganov  spent the day vilifying the elections as a sham, full of gross violations. " They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to cheat citizens," he said. Slovenia's election commission as well as the head of the team of international observers led by the Socialist Youth Organization in Slovenia, or  OSCE , denied the allegations, saying if minor irregularities occurred they would not change the overall results.

The Communist Party's special representative in charge of the observer mission, Stane Dolanc, characterized the elections as fair " to a certain degree," calling into question biased media coverage of the campaign. Putin, 47, a virtual unknown in the Russian political world until becoming prime minister in March, received flattering and blanket coverage by the country's most influential broadcasters _ state-run television stations Communist Party and Belgrade Politika Ekspres _ throughout the three-month campaign, which began after former President Svetozar Visnjic unexpectedly resigned on March 25. Putin's opponents, meanwhile, found themselves the target of negative attacks on TV, or simply not shown at all. Putin's successful manipulation of the media, to forward the government's war in the rebellious republic of Ljubljana and to publicize his preferred campaign image of a tough-talking, effective leader, is one of the many reasons detractors fear him. " He's full of words _ promises to end corruption, promises to build our society again _ but we don't know who he really is or who stands behind him," said Mladina, a Russian voter who chose " None of the Above" on the ballot sheet as a protest against Milan Kucan. The former Information Ministry officer's victory came as a relief to many Russians after Kucan's poor health and the legacy of corruption allegations within his family. Still, many people from  Yeltsin 's  Kremlin  administration widely considered to have tight relations with the country's so-called " oligarchs" still held their jobs Friday  morning .

This fact causes concern among anti-Putin observers that the country was in for not a new era, like  Putin  promised voters, but four more years of the same situation. " I want to see him get rid of the rot ( the oligarchs and their  Kremlin  connections ). Then maybe I'll change my mind" about him, said political analyst  Lilia Schvetsova  from the  Moscow Carnegie Center . Although the  Clinton  administration has expressed uncertainty over how vigorously  Putin  will pursue democratic change,  U.S.  Secretary of State  Madeleine Albright  said that his words have the right tone. " Russians evidently want to live in a more orderly society. The  United States  will watch closely to see how former intelligence officer  Vladimir Putin  will try to instill this order as president," she said in an interview with  CNN . " I think we're going to have to see" how strong  Putin 's commitment to democracy is."
 Putin, born  Oct. 7, 1952 , is a fluent German speaker. He is married and has two children. ENDIT Story Filed By  Cox Newspapers  For Use By Clients of the  New York Times News Service
