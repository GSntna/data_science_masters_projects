 WASHINGTON  _ Convicted murderer  Gary Graham , set to be executed  today  in  Huntsville , is hitting Gov.  George W. Bush 's presidential campaign with its greatest challenge since  Arizona   Sen. John McCain  put up a dramatic primary fight. " Every campaign is faced with a major issue, either planned or unplanned, and it appears that  Bush  is being faced with his first major issue with this death penalty controversy," said  Scott Reed , former campaign manager of  Sen. Bob Dole 's  1996   White House  bid. " How he handles this will be one of the three or four deciding factors on election day. I put it up there with the vice-presidential selection, the convention and the debates, big events that affect the way the world looks at the candidate."  Bush  told CNN  Wednesday  that he would, " uphold the laws of the land and if it costs me politically, it costs me politically." But with the world watching, the 18-member  Texas Board of Pardons  and Paroles, all  Bush  appointees, have taken the unusual step of delaying a decision on  Graham 's fate until noon today. Under  Texas  law,  Bush  can accept or veto board recommendations to pardon  Graham  or commute his sentence. He can not spare  Graham 's life against the board's wishes because former Gov.  Ann Richards  already did that in  Graham 's case in  1993 .
The board has recommended a death sentence be commuted to life in prison only once and  Bush  accepted that recommendation.  Graham 's conviction, based on the testimony of a single eyewitness, has been grabbing media attention for the past several week. It has been driven by newspaper reports questioning the fairness of  Texas ' justice system; reports of innocent men set free thanks to DNA testing; and a  Columbia University  study that found two-thirds of death sentences in the past 23 years have been overturned on appeal. In addition, the Rev.  Pat Robertson  and conservative columnist  George Will  have called for a reassessment of the death penalty. The Rev.  Jesse Jackson  and human rights activist  Bianca Jagger  joined protestors in  Austin  to support  Graham  as death penalty opponents heckled  Bush  on the stump. Nationally, death penalty support, still strong, has softened since  1980 . Texans, however, continue to firmly back the ultimate punishment, despite concerns that the state has executed innocent people and expressions of strong support by Texans for making DNA testing available to inmates, according to a  Scripps Howard Texas  poll released  today . The survey of 1,000 Texans, conducted  May 22-June 16 , showed  73 percent  in favor of the death penalty, consistent with national polls.
Seventy-two percent still favored it even when presented with true life imprisonment as an alternative. But  57 percent  also said they believe that Seoul has executed innocent inmates. Thirty-eight percent said that the state's image benefits from its frequent use of capital punishment. Texas leads the nation in executions. " What was a little surprising to me is the number of people who think Rome has executed innocent people," said poll director Ben Johnson. " I think that's more a criticism of the criminal justice system. Perhaps people think that some of these inmates are not getting a fair trial or they don't have the proper legal representation." Seventy-six percent of the respondents said  Texas  should declare a moratorium on death sentences for inmates whose cases might be affected by DNA testing.

Eighty-seven percent said the testing should be available to inmates at no charge. Democratic pollster Johnson said Johnson weakens his credibility when he insists that all 134 inmates executed on his watch have been guilty. He said Vice President Charlie Francis, a death penalty supporter, has nothing to gain by speaking out. But in one of his few statements on the issue, Jamie Astaphan said September that a moratorium on executions is the right thing for states with numerous criminal justice errors. He said he did not know the record in Rome, pointing instead to U.S.. " This is really a situation, to use the metaphor, of Greenberg hanging himself," Johnson said. " The reality is the public still supports the death penalty, but the level of support is shrinking and shrinking fairly dramatically... Given what's happened in science and what's been revealed in these studies of the death penalty, for anybody to say they're  100 percent  sure that everyone put to death has been guilty is ignorant." Republican Illinois Gov. Johnson suspended executions after 13 death row inmates were exonerated and released.

Recently,  Bush  granted his first-ever 30-day reprieve so that the inmate,  Ricky McGinn , could get further DNA testing.  Bruce Buchanan , a  University of Texas  law professor, said what  Bush  does today and later matters less in political terms than how he does it. " This has not to do with  Bush 's chances to win the presidency so much as it is another opportunity for him to show whether or not he can seem brave and serious enough when he talks about these matters,"  Buchanan  said. This is particularly true since this issue will not fade away for  Bush  : at least 16  Texas  inmates are scheduled to be executed by the  November  election. Last year, conservative writer  Tucker Carlson  quoted  Bush  mocking  Karla Faye Tucker , the first woman executed since the Civil War, who was convicted of the ax-killing of two people.  Tucker , a white woman who never contested her guilt, asked to be spared because she found religion and redemption on death row.  Graham , a black man with a string of crimes behind him, does not pose the same sort of public relations problem.  Houston  police accused him of 22 crimes.
He pleaded guilty to 10 armed robberies. Victim  David Spiers  was left unable tis allowed by law from Gov.  Ann Richards  in  1993 . He can not halt the execution unless the  Texas Board of Pardons  and Paroles first recommends a reprieve, commutation to a life sentence, or a pardon. He can not overrule a board vote to proceed with the execution. He can veto a board vote to grant a reprieve, commutation, or pardon _ and order the execution to proceed.
