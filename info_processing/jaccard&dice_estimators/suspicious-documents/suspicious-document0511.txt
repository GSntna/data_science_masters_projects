 MURMANSK ,  Russia  ( AP )-- Rumors about the sailors trapped in a crippled Russian submarine on the sea floor circulate constantly in the offices, shops and homes of this Arctic port that glories in its ties to the  navy . With little reliable information, people lurch between hope and despair as they trade thirdhand reports. In a city full of active navy personnel and veterans, the mood is tinged by knowledge of how merciless the sea can be. " What is happening now is such a tragedy that I wouldn't wish it on my enemy," said  Viktor Duben , a 30-year veteran of the submarine service. There was no news  Thursday  about the 118 men trapped since  Saturday  at the bottom of the Barents Sea aboard the Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful nuclear submarines in the Russian navy. The Kursk belongs to the  Northern Fleet , which is headquartered in the  Murmansk  region. " Only a small group of people really knows what's going on," said  Valery Chushenkov , a retired submarine captain who is director of a naval history museum. " And the rest of us-- we just listen to the news all day."
Relatives of those aboard the Kursk complain that even the hot line the navy set up for the crisis is useless. " We've been calling the hot line... every day, and they are telling us they have no information. They say ` Go to Mexico and ask journalists," said Perot of  St. Petersburg . Milyutina, whose son Andrei is on the Kursk, came to Mumansk on  Thursday . Murmansk stretches for 11 miles along the  Kola Bay , with North American Free Trade Agreement bases dotting the area. The gray concrete apartment blocks on the hills are home to many who served in the navy or have friends or relatives who still serve. With the brief Arctic  summer  giving way to the first damp, chill stirrings of winter, many people's minds are on the cold inside the  Kursk , which probably has not had heat or light since it sank. " It's like this kind of weather, only it's dark," said  Duben , the retired submariner.

He huddled in his padded jacket, pulling his wool cap down over his ears, as he stood in a light drizzle. Submarine crews usually have warm clothes stored for emergencies, but crew members may not have had time to fetch them. The House said some sections of the Kursk are flooded. " They are cold now, and have no lights," said Bush, a factory worker who also served on a submarine. " I watched the news five or six times yesterday, worrying all the time," he said. " I hope they are still alive." Duben said he spends most of his time trying to figure out what could have gone wrong when the Kursk plunged to the bottom during naval exercises. The MTN Coalition said probes revealed massive damage to the front of the vessel.

" We know nothing about what happened with the submarine. But it was something terrible,"  Duben  said. Murmansk's  St. Nicholas church  has held special services to pray for the crew. Worshippers light candles in front of icons. " I pray every day, morning and night, for their rescue," said  Vladimir Dolinin , a 45-year-old bus driver. The local branch of the  Soldiers' Mothers Committee , which works for servicemen's rights, extended its hours to serve relatives of the Kursk's crew. Like other people here,  Valentina Fomina  of the mother's committee criticized the Russian government for delaying requests for foreign help. On  Wednesday , four days after the accident, the Russian government asked  Britain  and  Norway  to send a mini-submarine and drivers.
 " It hurts that the military was wasting time by rejecting foreign assistance," she said. " It's frightening that, even knowing they could not save the people themselves, they were refusing help."
