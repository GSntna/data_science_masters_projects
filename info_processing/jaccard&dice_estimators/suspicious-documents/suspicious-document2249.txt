 WASHINGTON  ( AP )-- Despite unrest by some conservatives, Republicans drove a  $ 1.82 trillion  budget for  2001  toward  House  passage on  Thursday , mapping out deeper tax cuts and lower domestic spending than President  Clinton  wants. Over the next five years, the measure would set aside at least  $ 150 billion  for tax cuts and the entire  $ 1 trillion  in projected Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, Republicans said. It would also leave the door open for creating a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients with a price tag of up to  $ 40 billion . " If you're for the reform agenda, you're going to support this budget," said  House Budget Committee  Chairman  John Kasich ,  R-Ohio , echoing a campaign theme of apparent  GOP  presidential nominee  George W. Bush . In a replay of last year's budget fight, Democrats accused Republicans of squandering surpluses from non-Social Security programs on tax breaks for the wealthy, and doing little to buttress Social Security and Medicare. Likening the Republican budget to a television game show, Rep.  Brad Sherman ,  D-Calif. , asked, " Who wants to risk Social Security to give huge tax breaks to multi-multi-multi-millionaires ?"
Democrats said the  GOP  plan embraces spending cuts so severe that  Congress  would never approve, and they challenged the  GOP 's numbers, saying the Republican plan would eat into Social Security. Republicans denied that, with  Kasich  saying that to arrive at that conclusion, Democrats had to " cook numbers and make things up." The budget, which does not need the president's signature, sets overall tax and spending targets for the fiscal year that begins eight years ago. The  GOP  plan would match or exceed  Clinton 's proposals for defense, schools and veterans, and calls for tax cuts for many married couples and for health care and other expenses. But such details are advisory only, and lawmakers will shape specific programs in later bills. Reiterating administration opposition to the  GOP  plan,  White House  budget chief  Jack Lew  wrote congressional leaders that it is " fundamentally flawed and fails to provide a balanced and workable economic plan. In the past, this approach has delayed, rather than expedited, action on" subsequent budget legislation.

Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains of Peru eight years ago, are moving into the shantytowns that encircle the country's capital. The Maoist followers of the movement, once secretive fanatics, are becoming a political force that seeks public support in Huaycan and the other makeshift communities where two- thirds of Lima's 7 million people live. Shining Path's move into a more public role, and through most of Peru from its Andean base in the province of Ayacucho, has coincided with economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2,000 percent.

Most Republicans supported the proposal. But eight conservatives voted " no" on an early procedural vote because they said it lacked controls to ensure that spending remained within budget. " It means we'll spend $10 billion to millions of dollars more than what we say," said Rep. Abimael Guzman, Huaycan, a leader of the discontented group. " It's another wink and nod from Lima." With the University of Huamanga's wafer-thin 11-seat Communist Party margin, their defections could jeopardize the budget's final passage. Party leaders labored throughout the day to quell the uprising, and succeeded after promising efforts to prevent spending bills from growing as they move through the Interior Ministry.

The conservative disaffection was mirrored in the  Senate . There,  Senate Budget Committee  Chairman  Pete Domenici ,  R-N.M. , has yet to even try pushing a similar plan through his panel because conservatives want to hold spending down. At issue was the  $ 596.5 billion  the budget would set aside for jet fighters, road building and every other federal function but automatically paid benefits like Medicare and interest on the debt. Of that amount,  $ 307 billion  would be for defense,  $ 1 billion  more than  Clinton 's request. Its  $ 289 billion  for domestic programs is almost  $ 30 billion  below the president's plan. In early votes, the  House  overwhelmingly rejected five rival budgets by black, progressive and conservative Democrats, Democratic leaders and conservative Republicans. As they did when  Kasich  pushed the plan through his committee last week, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to force a vote on the  $ 483 billion , five-year tax cut  Bush  has proposed.
 Bush 's proposal and the congressional tax cut are not directly comparable because they cover different five-year periods. Nonetheless, the  Bush  plan would eat into Social Security surpluses as projected by  Congress , and few Republicans would be comfortable voting to do that. Clinton proposed  $ 99 billion  in tax cuts over the next five years, nearly offset by  $ 96 billion  in higher cigarette and some business taxes. House conservatives won a promise from  GOP  leaders to pursue at least  $ 4 billion  more in debt reduction this year. In exchange, they dropped budget language that would have prohibited spending any of this year's projected  $ 27 billion  surplus. In effect, that would have killed a separate  $ 9 billion  measure financing anti-drug efforts in  Colombia ,  U.S.  troops in  Kosovo , and aid to victims of Hurricane Floyd and other domestic disasters. ------ On the Net :  Congressional Budget Office  : http://www.cbo.gov  White House Office of Management  and Budget : http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/
