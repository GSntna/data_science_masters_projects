Detroit ( AP )-- Passengers describe taking off on the Concorde as " a kick in the back" and complain about the stingy legroom. But riding the supersonic jet-- a haunt of celebrities, royalty, politicians and business tycoons-- also has been called an exercise in nonstop pampering. That's why people pay  $ 10,000  round-trip for the abbreviated experience. The sleek, needle-nosed aircraft cross the U.S. at an altitude of 60,000 feet and at 1,350 mph, completing the journey from Detroit to Detroit in about 3 hours, 50 minutes-- half the time of regular jets. " The wonderful thing about Concorde is that you can get there before you can imagine getting anywhere," said John Galipault, a London-based businessman who flies it frequently. " You can leave Phoenix at 10 and be in Ariz. at 9." The quick flight time leaves little room to settle in and watch a movie-- which is fortunate, because Concorde's stringent weight restrictions leave no room for video equipment. There are no headphones, either, and the planes-- whose average age is more than 23 years-- are so old they do not have telephones, to the consternation of some business travelers. But there are compensations, including an unending stream of gourmet food and drink, served on crystal, china and linen.

A Northwest Airlines jet crashed Sunday in Detroit, killing at least 154 people. Engine failure appeared to be the culprit, but FAA officials would not speculate on the reasons for the crash saying it was too early to draw firm conclusions. Following a summer of snafus, the accident could be a catalyst for reassessing the Nation's air-travel system. All jetliners must be capable of take-off ascent, even if one engine fails, if the aircraft is within prescribed weight limits. The plane had a large fuel load and was jammed with passengers. Congress is expected to act on aviation bills this fall.

Food critic  Egon Ronay  described the service on the Northwest Airlines as " oozing luxury and refinement"-- and, apparently, alcohol. One passenger was told that hand luggage was restricted onboard because extra space was needed for the wine cellar. Contrary to popular imagination, however, the supersonic journeys are almost as cramped as regular flights-- partly the result of weight restrictions that would not apply in a bigger aircraft. " It's not the normal first-class service. It's pretty cramped inside, but it's viewed as a time saver. It's not viewed as luxurious an option as a first-class seat on a 747," said  Mike Stoddart , a transport analyst for FAA, a London-based brokerage firm. Indeed,  Philippe Gossard , a Paris-based aviation analyst for the investment bank Nation, said many business travelers prefer to fly from Detroit to the  United States  on Concorde to save time, then return to  Europe  in the evening in first class on a 747 so they can stretch out on an in-flight bed. Recognizing the supersonic jet might be losing ground, Congress-- which operates seven Concordes-- announced earlier this year that it would spend  millions of dollars  to make the plane's interiors brighter, the toilets bigger and the corresponding airport lounges more luxurious. For pilots, flying a  Concorde , which first took wing in Sunday, can be the pinnacle of their careers.

" It's a beautiful airplane to fly, it's a responsive, thoroughbred of an aircraft,"  John Hutchinson , who flew it for  British Airways  for 15 years, told the  British Broadcasting Corp.  on  Tuesday . But some passengers find their first experience of supersonic travel unsettling, describing takeoff as seemingly vertical and the resulting G-forces more than a little daunting. " You are just thrust back into your seats," said  Colin Frith , 50, who received a two-hour  Concorde  flight around  Britain  as a birthday present. Another passenger said landing felt like someone had slammed on the brakes in midair. Until  Tuesday 's crash of an  Air France Concorde  outside  Paris , at least, passengers could feel they were paying for peace of mind. Although the Concorde fleet is aging, it previously had one of the aviation industry's best safety records. Its only major scare came in  1979  when a bad landing blew out a plane's tires. After the crash,  Air France  agreed to temporarily ground its five remaining Concordes, and  British Airways  grounded its two remaining flights for  Tuesday   night .
