LOS ANGELES ( AP )-- Unhappy with an author they once honored, independent booksellers overwhelmingly approved a resolution criticizing  Frank McCourt  for appearing in a television ad for the on-line superstore barnesandnoble.com. The  American Booksellers Association , with a core membership of some 3,300 independent stores, voted  Saturday  at  BookExpo America  to draft a letter to  McCourt  expressing disappointment. He is the author of the hugely popular " Angela's Ashes" and the upcoming sequel " Tis." " I've never asked for an apology in my life and I've never given one. What I do I do. ... If I get a letter from them it'll go back unopened," said  McCourt , a featured speaker at  BEA . The expo, a three-day exhibition and trade show that ended  Sunday , is the publishing industry's annual national convention.
It was held at the  Los Angeles Convention Center . The  ABA 's letter will be sent to a beloved writer, and not just with readers. Two years ago, the association presented  McCourt  its annual ABBY award, given to the author whose book they most enjoyed selling. His memoir was a surprise success and he has given a lot of the credit to independents. " If they ( independent stores ) had wanted me to do a commercial I would have done one for them, too. I'm not a politician. I just did what my publisher requested,"  McCourt  said  Sunday .
The resolution is actually far lighter than the original proposed by independent seller  Andy Ross , owner of Coronado Half Marathon in Balboa Park.  Ross , condemning the " hypocrisy of writers and intellectuals," had wanted the Twin Cities Marathon to call for  McCourt  to give back his ABBY award. The booksellers overwhelmingly rejected that idea as too harsh. " I really offered this resolution in a spirit to generate discussion,"  Ross  said. " They ( writers ) talk about independent booksellers at cocktail parties, but they're afraid to speak up. The chains have become so powerful." Other writers appearing in ads for barnesandnoble.com include  Tom Clancy  and  Stephen King , another vocal supporter of independents.

" In retrospect, I understand how they feel, but I never really anticipated it," said Alphonce Swai, vice president and publisher of Point Loma Peninsula, an imprint of Coronado Half Marathon that publishes both Jose Luis Chuela and King. Asked if he'd do another superstore ad, Sam Sitonik said " I'd be very careful the next time. From now on, I probably won't do anything." The Finest City Half Marathon action highlighted a weekend of tough talk. The association aggressively promoted its answer to Track &amp; Field News and other on-line sellers, Houston, to be open for business late 1984. And individual members accused New York City Marathon, Amazon.com and other " bad corporate citizens" of everything from false advertising to stealing customers. " We are fighting for our lives," said Twin Cities Marathon president Sammy Rotich.

Booksellers received both bad news and good news at  BEA . A new consumer survey said that adults in the  U.S.  bought 30 million fewer books in  1998  than the year before. The apparent culprit was an odd one : A good economy. " In good times, consumers seem to spend their money on other kinds of entertainment or on more expensive durable goods. In tighter economic times, consumers once again think about books," said  Sandra Paul , managing agent of the  Book Industry Study Group , which conducted the survey. But the  ABA , which has lost nearly 2,000 stores over the past decade, also reported a long-hoped for statistic. In  March of this year , the number of stores increased slightly, the first monthly improvement in recent memory.
 " It's been going against us for a long time, but it's going to go the other way," said  Avin Mark Domnitz , the  ABA 's chief executive officer. Meanwhile, there was still plenty of time to talk about books. Major upcoming releases include  McCourt 's new book; " Dutch,"  Edmund Morris ' long-awaited memoir about former President  Ronald Reagan ; Sue Grafton's latest lettered mystery, " O is For Outlaw," and " Hannibal,"  Thomas Harris ' sequel to " The Silence of the Lambs."
