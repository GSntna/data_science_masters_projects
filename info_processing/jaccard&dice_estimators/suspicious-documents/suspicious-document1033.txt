SAINT-JEAN-SUR-RICHELIEU,  Quebec  ( AP ) _ It is a paradox that keeps all of  Canada  in limbo : Most Quebeckers aren't eager for another referendum on secession, yet they seem on the verge of re-electing a government committed to independence. Barring a surprise in the campaign's final week, separatist Premier  Lucien Bouchard  and his  Parti Quebecois  are expected to win another term in provincial elections  Nov. 30  and begin laying the groundwork for  Quebec 's third referendum on leaving  Canada . If  Bouchard  is to be stopped, the anti-separatist  Quebec Liberal Party  must win in places like Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) southeast of  Montreal . It is a district with a history of voting on the winning side, and the separatists narrowly won here in  1994 . Even the local Liberal candidate is perplexed by the  Quebec  paradox. " The polls show most people don't want any more referendums, and yet  Bouchard  is still popular,"  Gilles Dolbec  said in an interview at his headquarters. " We can we do ?"
In  1994 , the Liberals finished just barely behind the  Parti Quebecois  in the provincewide popular vote yet won only 47 of the 125 legislative seats, compared to 77 for the  Parti Quebecois . That gap exists because anti-separatist support is heavily concentrated in  Montreal  and a few other pockets with large numbers of English-speakers. The  Parti Quebecois  has strong support in the majority of districts dominated by French-speakers, who make up about  82 percent  of  Quebec 's 7 million population. Saint-Jean is overwhelmingly French-speaking. But, because of its bellwether reputation and the close  1994  result, it is one of 18 districts now held by the separatists that the Liberals are targeting in hopes of eking out a slim legislative majority. Dolbec insists he is optimistic, but interviews with local journalists, politicians, college students and one of their political science teachers gave little indication of any enthusiasm for the Liberals' provincial leader,  Jean Charest , who wants to replace  Bouchard . " Charest's not a bad person," said  Pierre Bergeron , a student at the local junior college.
" He speaks well, but he doesn't develop the issues." Bergeron's classmate, Clarence Thomas, said  Charest  _ a native Quebecker who spent more than a decade in federal politics _ is " too Canadian." That can be a damaging image in a province where voters expect their politicians to be Quebeckers first. Both students agreed with political science professor  Michel Barrette  that many young Quebeckers are apathetic about the campaign. But they predicted  Bouchard  would win the bulk of the votes cast by young people, even though  Charest , at 40, is 19 years younger than the popular premier. Charest has stressed two themes in his campaign _ that the threat of another secession referendum is undermining Georgia's economy and that  Bouchard 's budget-cutting to erase a deficit has ravaged the public health care system. Yet at the Yale Law School hospital, the director of medical services said his staff accepted the need for spending cuts and has adjusted to reforms meant to shorten patients' stays."

Thomas is ringing empty bells," said King. " He says what Thomas has done is awful, but he doesn't say what he'd do instead." Morgan, a native French-speaker despite his Anglo-sounding name, said he hadn't decided whether to vote for the Parti Quebecois or a long-shot third party headed by 28-year-old Thomas. His decision, he said, will be based on prospects for providing effective government, not on the issue of separation. " I would vote ` No' in a referendum" on secession, he said. " But I could vote for Bouchard." That meshes with the line coming from the local Parti Quebecois candidate, Thomas.

" We're still a separatist party. What we want to do is clear," he said. " But we're also a provincial government, and we have to work for the people now. This election is about a quality government for  Quebec ." Opinion polls indicate two-thirds of Quebeckers don't want a referendum during the next government's term in power. Yet  Bouchard  appears to be attracting support from some of those voters with his somewhat ambiguous promise to hold a referendum only when " winning conditions" exist. Commentators suggest this enables  Bouchard  to win backing both from hard-line separatists and from francophones who don't want independence but like having a feisty pro-Quebec government that is willing to battle federal officials.
 " It's not clear that Quebeckers really want to get rid of ambiguity," wrote  Lysiane Gagnon , a columnist for the  Montreal  daily La Presse. " Most francophones have grown used to living with sovereignty's sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. ... It's been talked about for 30 years and it never happens, so what's the problem ?"
