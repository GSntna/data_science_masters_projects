SEATTLE _ Buoyed by ad hoc accords that have boosted salmon spawning in both Puget Sound and  British Columbia  rivers,  Washington  Gov.  Gary Locke  and  Canada 's fisheries minister,  David Anderson , say this is the year to resolve the U.S.-Canada fisheries dispute up and down the  Pacific Coast . " If we can not deal with problems on this coast, what hope is there for dealing with the crisis of overfishing worldwide ?" Anderson asked  Thursday  in a  Seattle  speech to the  World Affairs Council . He echoed the optimism of Vice President  Al Gore , who said in a  February  interview that the  United States  will make a major push this year to reach a long-term fisheries agreement with  Canada . And  Locke , encouraged by results of interim accords, said : " It is time to come to a long-term U.S.-Canada agreement that focuses on recovery of salmon in all of our rivers." Anderson and  Locke  celebrated a trio of two-way deals that have made an immediate, positive impact on several of the  Northwest 's most imperiled salmon runs.  Washington  agreed  last June  to restrict the recreational catch of coho salmon bound for the  Thompson River  in  British Columbia , and later to hold off the start of fishing for sockeye salmon bound for the  Stuart River .
In turn, the Canadians cut back ocean fishing off  Vancouver Island  for Puget Sound-bound chinook and coho salmon. The result has been much higher numbers of adult spawning salmon _ particularly imperiled 1987 chinook salmon in the region. " We successfully concentrated on finding a solution rather than apportioning the blame,"  Locke  said. Locke and leaders of local governments in the region face a big challenge in the recent listing of Puget Sound-area salmon under the Endangered Species Act. The listing is likely to require multiple measures to improve spawning habitat. But,  Anderson  maintained, money done to nurture salmon in streams will be wasted drain unless conservation measures are taken at sea. " The other half of the equation is to get adult salmon back from the  Pacific Ocean  to their spawning beds," said  Anderson , a longtime conservationist who represents  Victoria  in  Canada 's House.

Over the past five years, the fishing dispute has repeatedly disrupted U.S.-Canadian relations. In 1987,  Canada 's fisheries ministry slapped a $5.2 billion " licensing fee" on Alaska-bound  U.S.  fishing boats using waters of British House's Inside Passage. Two years ago, House Premier Anthony Beilenson tried to have  U.S.  submarines barred from a torpedo testing range on  Vancouver Island . In the 1970 a blockade by Low Income Energy Assistance fishing boats prevented the  Alaska  Ferry " Malaspina" from leaving the dock in  Prince Rupert . However, the past year has seen a major change of policy and attitude in  Canada . Instead of hammering at historic inequities in the salmon catch _ U.S.-fishermen catch millions of salmon bound for Canadian rivers _ Thomas Downey has put heavy emphasis on conservation. He moved last year to curtail fishing of coho salmon.

Instead of the two-five million coho salmon caught annually by B.C. commercial fishermen in the mid-1990s, only 100,000 coho were caught by all fisheries _ commercial, sport and native _ in  1998 . " Confrontation makes everyone poorer,"  Anderson  said  Thursday . " Our constituencies are tired of arguments over who would kill the last fish." Anderson's policy has met with opposition from the  British Columbia  government and the  United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union . But his strategy has proven as popular a cause in  British Columbia  as the restoration of salmon is south of the border. " Salmon are a totem of this part of the world," he said. " Salmon are also the canary in the mine as far as the condition of our environment.
 If salmon are okay in our streams... the environment must be all right." Locke agreed, calling salmon " the very definition of the  Pacific Northwest ."  Anderson  said technical discussions between Canadian fisheries experts and their  Alaska  counterparts " are going surprisingly well... I believe we can get to an agreement this year."
In an editorial in the Wall Street Journal the merits of the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987 are questioned. The bill is scheduled for debate by the House today. The Journal suggests the Act merely expands existing programs without reducing overall welfare dependency. It also points out that less than 25% of the expenditure will go toward reform such as welfare-to-work programs, and really amounts to an expansion of the status-quo. The editorial suggests welfare reform should: 1. shrink the deficit 2. reduce incentives to remain on welfare, and 3. make work the focus of the system. The House bill falls short of these goals.
