INTERNATIONAL CUBA-ELIAN _  MIAMI  _ Demonstrators sang and prayed outside the home where  Elian Gonzales  is staying as all sides in the custody battle waited for a federal appeals court ruling that could lead to the boy's reunion with his father. The court action could come at any time. (  Williams ,  Cox News Service  ) MOVED ELIAN-CUBANS _ The legendary clout of  Miami 's exile community has never been so obvious as during its spirited, unified standoff against the  U.S.  government and  Janet Reno , a former  Miami  hero. Is this the last hurrah of the exile community as a political force or the beginning of something even more powerful ? The buzz has been that since the death of long-time power broker  Jorge Mas Canosa  and the arrival of more moderate rivals to his  Cuban-American National Foundation , the community clout had begun to wane. The  Clinton  administration has managed to play the different groups off against each other more than once. But now even the naysayers are taking notice of what a motivated exile community can do when truly aroused. Elian has united this often never-quite-so-monolithic community as never before. And so far, they've managed to thumb their nose successfully at the full might of the federal government. Whither the storied  Miami  exile enclave ?
(  Douthat ,  Palm Beach Post  ). 25. MOVED  WASHINGTON  IMF-PROTESTS _  WASHINGTON  _ Police staged a pre-emptive raid and closed the headquarters of world finance protests  Saturday , saying the aging warehouse was unsafe and claiming they found ingredients to make a firebomb.

( Dart/Schulktz,  Cox News Service  ) MOVED SCHOOL-SAFETY-1STLD _  WASHINGTON  _ Some 3,000 students at  Montgomery Blair High School  evacuated their school in  Washington 's  Maryland  suburbs at noon recently and rambled three blocks to the grounds of another school. Meanwhile, security teams scoured the building. It was all part of a three-hour drill on how to escape shootings or explosions, part of a national trend toward protectiveness unequalled since the  1950 's, when millions of school children took part in " duck and cover" drills designed to help them survive nuclear attacks. Experts talk about what else has changed _ and hasn't changed _ nationally since the shootings at  Columbine High School  nearly one year ago. (  Mollison, Cox News Service  ). EDs : MOVED  Thursday . GORE-MEADOWLANDS _ EAST  RUTHERFORD ,  N.J.  _ With Earth Day fast approaching, Vice President Al Gore faces a situation here that could test his environmental credentials. The  Mills Corp.  of  Virginia , whose executives and associates have given  $ 43,000  to the Gore presidential campaign, want to develop a shopping center on 90 acres of wetlands in the  Meadowlands  here. But the mall project is opposed by  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  a prominent environmentalist who has endorsed Gore as " the strongest environmentalist running for the  White House  since Teddy Roosevelt."
The  Meadowlands Mills  project has thus become a possible litmus test for Gore's environmental agenda. (  Shepard, Cox News Service  ). WITH PHOTOS and LOCATOR MAP. EDs : MOVED  Thursday . OSCILLATE _  WASHINGTON  _ Now that it's becoming clear that the tropical  Pacific Ocean 's inability to make up its mind about  El Ninos and La Ninas  has something to do with the severity of  Atlantic  hurricanes, atmospheric scientists say an even bigger climate oscillation may be occurring. Conditions in the north  Pacific  seem to be switching from " North Pacific Oscillation 1" to " North Pacific Oscillation 2." And what that shift lacks in colorful Spanish terminology, it more than makes up for in bad weather : several decades of worse-than-normal hurricane seasons. (  Nesmith, Cox News Service  ). WITH : OSCILLATE-DATA EDs : MOVED  Wednesday . CHICKEN-NUGGETS-1STLD _  WASHINGTON  _ Two  Gold Kist Inc.  poultry processing plants in  Alabama  that supply chicken to school lunch programs nationwide were overwhelmed earlier this year by diseased poultry, federal investigators have reported.

(  Suggs ,  Atlanta  Journal-Constitution ) COLUMBINE-MAIN _ The jolt of gunfire that shattered the halls of  Columbine High School  still splits the air over  Colorado 's amber plains, roars over purple mountains, drowns the cacophony of its crystal rivers and clatters down red canyons. Many people, including several who wrote us, have thoughts, hopes, memories and fears about  Columbine  as we approach the first-year anniversary. (  Grand Junction Daily Sentinel  ). 65. WITH PHOTOS. MOVED WITH COLUMBINE-HEALING _ Forget all the talk about " closure." The fact is that the students, teachers, friends and families of victims may move on but a sense of loss will always be with them. How has the anniversary reopened wounds ? How are students and families dealing with the stress of the anniversary ? How have victims of other tragedies, i.e.  Oklahoma City  bombing, survived and what lessons might they offer for  Columbine  ? (  Sauer, Grand Junction Daily Sentinel  ). 40. MOVED DAVIDIANS-COMPOUND _  WACO ,  Texas  _ An overview of  Mount Carmel , an unappetizing piece of almost barren property now virtually synonymous throughout the world with Waco.
What was there then, what was left behind, construction of a new church, dispute over property ownership, its symbolic value for Davidians and their sympathizers. (  England ,  Waco Tribune-Herald  ) MOVED WITH DAVIDIANS-MEMORIAL _  WACO ,  Texas  _ A look at the plans of Davidians and sympathizers to mark the  April 19 anniversary of the 1993  fire. There will be a service at the compound  April 19 , probably during morning hours. ( England/Witherspoon,  Waco  Tribune-Herald ) MOVED POLITICS GORE-TEXAS _ Fifth-worst poverty rate. Second-worst hunger problem. Second in the number of children without health insurance. Forty-fifth in homeownership. These are the  Texas  statistics that Vice President Al Gore trotted out last week when Gov.  George W. Bush  unveiled health-care and housing proposals designed to cement his image as a " compassionate conservative." Though not all of Gore's numbers withstand scrutiny,  Texas  almost always fares poorly when it is compared to other states on social services. (  Greenberger ,  Austin  American-Statesman ) MOVED WITH BUSHPOLLS _ Last week, while  Al Gore  was touting numbers he believes show that  George W. Bush  is an under-achieving governor who never should be president the  Bush  campaign was shopping numbers they believe indicate Gore never will be president. (  Herman ,  Austin  American-Statesman ) MOVED DEMS-HOLLYWOOD _ In a rare joint fundraising appearance with the Hollywood elite,  Bill Clinton  and Al Gore raised more than  $ 2 million last night  (  Saturday  ) at the historic  Greystone Mansion  in  Beverly Hills .

MOVED POL-TICKER _ A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from Cox staff and wire reports. (  Cox News Service  ) ETA :  9 p.m. EDT . OPED/EDITORIAL TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Libel was the issue in a  London  courtroom but history was on trial. British historian  David Irving  had charged that American historian  Deborah Lipstadt  libeled him when she wrote that he is a Holocaust denier, an anti-Semite and a Hitler apologist. History won. Be glad. Just don't be complacent. (  Tom Teepen  is national correspondent for  Cox Newspapers . ) MOVED THURSDAY.KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Eds :  Howard Kleinberg  is monitoring events in  Miami  today and will try to write for  Sunday  after the Elian situation becomes clear ( or doesn't ). MOVED (  Howard Kleinberg  is a columnist for  Cox News Service . ) GLASS-COLUMN _  WASHINGTON  _ Anticipating a wartime boom in aluminum demand,  Alcoa  expanded rapidly, winding up in  1945  with  90 percent  of the  U.S.  raw ingot market. Nobody claimed mighty  Alcoa  had achieved its monopoly by illegal means, jacked up prices or harmed customers. But that didn't save  Alcoa  from being broken up. The precedent is there for  Microsoft .
(  Andy Glass  is a columnist for  Cox News Service  in the  Washington  bureau. ) MOVED THURSDAY. LIFESTYLE SWIMSUIT _ Finding the perfect swimsuit. In this Olympic year, we need suits that go the distance. Gold, silver, bronze. Red, white and blue. Neons, florals, racing stripes... Olympic swimmers, divers, water polo players and synchronized swimmers don't have much say about what they wear to the pool. Their primary considerations are patriotic and athletic, but those aren't taken lightly. ( Among sprinters and distance swimmers, there's currently a controversy brewing over the use of neck-to-ankle suits _ a look that is no doubt as hard to tug on as it is to pull off. ) (  Sturrock ,  Palm Beach Post  ). WITH PHOTOS and LAYOUTS. MOVED ESSAYIST-PROFILE _ YOUNG  HARRIS ,  Ga.  _ For 20 years,  Steve Harvey , a professor at  Young Harris College  in  North Georgia , wrote poems before finding his real voice in the personal essay. In two collections, " A Geometry of Lilies : Life and Death in an American Family" and " Lost in Translation," he writes with fluent ease about love and marriage, about change and loss. His tone is by turns winsome and reflective.
" People ask me what my books are about," he says. " It's very hard to say." He will write of his kids ganging up on him ( " I marvel at the transparent guile of their planning huddles, the determined looks as they gather courage for the synchronized assault, their reckless confidence as they throw their bodies at their father." ) or of discovering he is perfectly happy living without a television ( " Our mind connects the dots, lending depth and perspective, and ultimately, meaning to the electronic trompe l'oeil of the tube. And yet, the experience sedates us, engaging just enough of our senses to lull us into a stupor." ). He writes what's on his mind, but what's on his mind always seems to lead somewhere else _ from the personal to what might be called the universal. (  Skube ,  Atlanta  Journal-Constitution ). 57. WITH PHOTOS and LAYOUT. MOVED CHICKENSOUP-MAIN _ A look at the proliferation of chicken soup books. There's chicken soup for the prisoner's soul, chicken soup cruises, where will it end ?

MOVED WITH CHICKENSOUP-SPOOF _ A spoof on " Chicken Soup for the Chicken Soul." It was a beautiful 1965 day, one I'll never forget. The sun was round and gold like a big bowl of creamed corn. The sky was blue like Clean ` n' Clear astringent face wash for sensitive skin. Fluffy puffs of clouds that looked like Farmer William Gray's white hair where it sticks out the back of his baseball cap floated along like they had nowhere to go. Come to think of it, they probably didn't. ( National Hurricane Center ). 12. MOVED PARENTING _ A parenting author claims her new book is a definitive decision-making guide for parents.

( Colorado State University, United States Tribune-Herald ) MOVED ENTERTAINMENT-ARTS CHARLES-OSGOOD _ Africa _ A conversation with  Charles Osgood , host of the critically acclaimed  CBS  program"  Sunday Morning ," which continues to have an almost liturgical appeal.

He won at  Atlanta  _ saved NASCAR _ almost caught up with  Bobby Labonte  at  Rockingham , was leading at  Bristol  when he was knocked out by  Kenny Irwin . Has this 48-year old found the fountain of youth ? Or is it rejuvenation from competing against his son ? Big E is in the top 5 of the standings and poised to compete for his eighth title, which would break a tie with  Richard Petty  for the most ever. Why is Earnhardt flourishing this year ? (  Levine, Cox News Service  ). 22. SWIMMING SWM-HALLOFFAME _  FORT LAUDERDALE ,  Fla.  _ The Summer Olympics are several months and half a world away.
