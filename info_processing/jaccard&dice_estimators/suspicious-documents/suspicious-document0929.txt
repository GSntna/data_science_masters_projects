The meetings have not been billed as emergency sessions, but with the  NBA  scheduled to announce the cancellation of more games, negotiations between owners and players may go a long way toward settling the nearly fourth-month-old labor impasse and salvaging the season. (  Frances Roberts/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT32 )  WASHINGTON --  Oct. 28, 1998 --  CLINTON , 10-28-- President  Clinton  making a robust defense of his public record on  Wednesday  at a joint news conference in the Rose Garden with President  Andres Pastrana  of  Colombia , in  Washington  on a state visit.

( Jim  Middleton/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT29 )  MARIETTA ,  Ga. --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- CLINTON-BARR, 10-28-- Rep.  Bob Barr ,  R-Ga. , blows out the candles on his 50th birthday cake during a party in  Marietta  on  Tuesday . Barr, who faces the world with a steady glare that Clintonites rate as villainous, began targetting the president well before the Lewinsky sex scandal broke. (  Alan S. Weiner/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT28 )  CAPE CANAVERAL ,  Fla. --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- SCI-SHUTTLE, 10-28-- The expected turnout of 3,700 media people covering the launch of the space shuttle Discovery ( whose crew includes 77-year-old  John Glenn  ) is thought to be the largest since the Apollo lunar flights.

(  Keith Meyers/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT27 ) UNDATED--  Oct. 28, 1998 -- REPUBS-CLINTON, 10-28-- Democrats on  Wednesday  gleefully seized on what they considered the Republicans' miscalculation in waging a last-minute  $ 10 million  advertising campaign exploiting President  Clinton 's sex scandal, calling it a desperation tactic.
In the ad,  Clinton  denies the Lewinsky affair, top; two women discuss the scandal; the Republicans make their pitch, below. (  New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT26 )  SAFRANBOLU ,  Turkey --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- TURKEY-ANNIVERSARY-2, 10-28-- A Kurdish woman stands in front of her home in the town of  Safranbolu  on  Tuesday .

(  Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT23 )  NEW YORK --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- ISRAEL-FILMS, 10-28--  Amos Gitai , director of " Day After Day," part of the Israeli film festival. " This is not a society that is outlined or completely established," says  Gitai , trying to explain the dynamics of the  Middle East  peace process. " It's volcanic, abrupt, with a reality that's constantly destabilized. It's a place where the great events of history crawl into the bedroom and don't leave you a moment of silence." (  Joyce Dopkeen/New York Times Photo  ) \* LITE ( NYT22 )  NEW YORK --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- CARTER-MUSIC-2, 10-28--  Elliott Carter  at his 90th birthday concert. There is a fastidiousness in  Carter 's ear for colors and the way he separates them one from another. The notes of a single horizontal line often fragment and pass from one instrument to the next; silences let in light.
Perhaps this is why music so dense with diverse agendas can sound so clear. (  G. Paul Burnett/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT21 )  NEW YORK --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- CARTER-MUSIC-1, 10-28--  William Purvis  conducting the  Speculum Musicae  at  Elliott Carter 's 90th birthday concert. The tribute was a showcase for the new and the recent. Only the eminent Double Concerto (  1961  ) and a brief song written 60 years ago looked very far into the past. (  G. Paul Burnett/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT20 )  NEW YORK --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- WOLF-THEATER, 10-28--  Kate Blumberg , as a child, with  Larry Bryggman  in  Hilary Bell 's " Wolf Lullaby."  Ms. Bell 's 75-minute play, set in a town in  Tasmania , is more intriguing for questions it raises than for how it embodies them dramatically. (  Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT19 )  NEW YORK --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- LOUIS-DANCE-REVIEW, 10-28--  Pamela Levy-Arauz , left, and  Kimberly Gibilisco  of  Murray Louis  and  Nikolais Dance  performing " Millennium Loop" at the  Joyce  on  Tuesday .
The dance technique  Nikolais  and  Louis  developed emphasizes quick, precise movements and these performers showed their mastery of it as they darted and hopped in a slightly staccato manner. (  Andrea Mohin/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT18 ) UNDATED--  Oct. 28, 1998 -- HOME IMPROVEMENT-B & W, 10-28-- Many homeowners become complacent about home security because they think they have nothing worth stealing. What these homeowners fail to realize is that a majority of burglars have no way of knowing what is inside a home. Most break in hoping to get lucky. Given enough time, a burglar will try to make his own luck by tearing into a house. (  Edward R. Lipinski/New York Times Illustration  ) \* LITE ( NYT17 )  YONKERS ,  N.Y. --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- NY-PATAKI-PROFILE, 10-28-- Gov.  George Pataki  and  Sen. Alfonse D'Amato  head to a campaign rally in  Yonkers  on  Wednesday .  Pataki  has made a career of being underestimated, and a habit of defying expectations.
And in the four years since his election, he has done just that, with considerable success. (  Andrea Mohin/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT16 ) UNDATED--  Oct. 28, 1998 -- MARTHASTEWART-PRETENDERS-2, 10-28-- Pumpkin carving of  Martha Stewart  by  Hugh McMahon . Armed with little more than a sheaf of recipes, a glue gun, some dried flowers and a puritanical zeal for modern homekeeping,  Martha Stewart  has built a  $ 200 million  multimedia empire. Thus, it comes as no surprise that pretenders are cropping up thicker than sprouts on a chia pet. ( Abe Frajndlich/New York Times Photo ) ( NYT15 )  NEW YORK --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- CIR-NEWYORKER-CARTOONS, 10-28--  Bob Mankoff , cartoon editor for The New Yorker, in his vast cartoon archive. He holds a laptop showing his Web site, Cartoon.com, which will soon add thousands of the magazine's cartoons. (  James Estrin/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT14 )  NEW YORK --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- CIR-MULTI-PLAYER-GAMES, 10-28--  Daniel Shiffman , a self-proclaimed geek, is an elite player of the on-line game called Myth : The Fallen Lords.
In Myth, each player can fight on line against everyone else, or competitors can form teams and carry out intricate strategies. (  Susan B. Markisz/New York Times Photo  ) \* LITE ( NYT13 )  NEW YORK --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- CIR-FASHION, 10-28--  Betty Lo Mann  and  Steve Mann  are connected by marriage as well as the matching cyborg suits designed by  Mann . " We understand each other more when we are connected,"  Ms. Mann  says. " It's the same way the left side of your brain is connected to the right side of your body, and so is the right side. There is no argument between the two sides." (  Brian Willer/New York Times Photo  ) ( NYT12 )  ST. LOUIS --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- CIR-HOME-SCHOOL-2, 10-28--  Mary  and Bill Pride, right, use 10 computers to teach, from left,  Madeleine ,  Lillian ,  Gregory , Mercy,  Frank ,  Magda ,  Sarah ,  Joe  and  Theodore . A survey of home schoolers in  Florida  has revealed a shift in recent years in the reasons for choosing home schooling : dissatisfaction with public and private schools was listed first most often, moving ahead of religious reasons.
( U.S. Congress ) ( NYT11 )  ST. LOUIS -- 1968-- CIR-HOME-SCHOOL-1, 10-28--  Mary Pride , publisher of Practical Homeschooling, with some of her children, who are educated at home. In the last two years, the number of home schoolers has tripled, and many participating families say they see home schooling as an alternative to mediocre public schools and expensive private schools. ( Brady Bill ) \* LITE ( NYT10 )  BETHEL ,  Alaska --  Oct. 28, 1998 -- CLASSROOM-AFTERMATH-BOS, 10-28--"  Josh 's Place" is carefully lettered on a backboard on a court where  Josh Palacios  played and near where he lived. Palacios and the principal of Senate,  Ron Edwards , were killed late last year by  Evan Ramsey  in the school's lobby.

( Rev Martin Luther King Jr ) \* LITE ( NYT6 ) Brady-- Wednesday-- NY-SUBWAY-PRESERVE, 10-28-- In a preservation move both bold and unprecedented, the entire Idaho subway system will be nominated to the White House. Wall Street's station, with vintage oak booth, stands to gain if the subway is on the Congress. ( Senate ) ( NYT5 ) Alaska-- past year and a half-- NY-BRONX-GARDEN-2, 10-28-- Who says vegetables must be planted in rows ? The serpentine garden can be seen growing at Wave Hill, the public garden in the US section of the US, known for its imagination and unusual plants.

The U.S. Congress this week passed the Brady Bill, its first significant gun- control law since 1968. Last week the Senate agreed to a ban on assault weapons. Perhaps the tide has changed in favor of gun control. On the other hand, election results show that a strong stand on gun control does not get candidates elected, and membership in the National Rifle Association has soared in the last two years. Although most of its members favor some degree of gun control the NRA's hard core opposes all restraints on the sale of firearms, arguing that firearms represent the best defense not only against criminals but against tyranny.
