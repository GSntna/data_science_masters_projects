 WASHINGTON  _ It is not the finger-wagging speech. It is not the infamous declaration that " I did not have sexual relations with that woman." It is not the adultery or even the lies to the American people. None of these individual acts, even many of President  Clinton 's harshest critics say, are impeachable offenses. Instead, the case for impeachment is a winding legal staircase, which must be understood step by step, according to those who believe that  Clinton 's actions must lead to his removal from office. The heart of the case against the president is the allegation that  Clinton  lied before the grand jury when he said his testimony in an earlier civil case was truthful.
Moreover,  Clinton  tried to obstruct justice and hide his relationship with former intern  Monica S. Lewinsky , according to the impeachment articles approved last month by the  House . To those who believe  Clinton  should be ousted, the evidence is so overwhelming they can't understand why the public backs  Clinton  or why the  Senate  seems likely to acquit him. " The evidence is very clear," said Representative  Bill McCollum  of  Florida , one of the 13  House  " managers" slated to present the case against  Clinton  in the  Senate  impeachment trial. " He committed the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice, and it is very clear these are impeachable offenses. It is an incredible thought that we would let the president remain in office if the senators came to the same conclusion that I have." McCollum, like several other  House  managers, said he views the upcoming trial as a last chance to convince the public that the case against  Clinton  has nothing to do with partisanship, but instead is based on irrefutable evidence and the mandates of the Constitution.
What follows is an attempt to explain the case against  Clinton , according to interviews with  House  managers and based on the array of evidence from independent counsel  Kenneth W. Starr  and the  House Judiciary Committee . The case revolves around two impeachment articles approved  Dec. 19  by the  House , finding that  Clinton  committed perjury before the grand jury and obstructed justice. -- Perjury. While the  House  rejected an impeachment article that said  Clinton  lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, it approved an article that said  Clinton  lied about many of the same facts before the federal grand jury. This has complicated matters for the  House  managers because in order to prove that  Clinton  lied before the grand jury, it must be established that  Clinton  lied in the civil case. " The burden of proof is higher," said Representative  James Sensenbrenner  of  Wisconsin , a  House  manager who is slated to deliver the opening statement in the  Senate  trial  Thursday .
" We have to prove he lied twice." But  Sensenbrenner  said it is clear the lie occurred in both cases. The lie, according to the  Starr  report and the  House Judiciary Committee , is that  Clinton  repeatedly denied having a sexual relationship with  Lewinsky  in the civil case. Or, as the impeachment article puts it,  Clinton  made " prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony in a Federal civil rights action brought against him."  Clinton 's defense, according to his lawyers, is that the definition of sexual relations used in the  Jones  case did not include oral sex. However, impeachment backers said even if that is true,  Clinton  made other false statements during his testimony.
For example,  Clinton  denied touching private parts of  Lewinsky 's body, which  Lewinsky  testified did occur. That has led Democratic critics such as Representative Barney Frank of  Massachusetts  to say that the case against  Clinton  is based on where he touched Lewinsky. But  Sensenbrenner  said such complaints are ludicrous, arguing there is ample proof that  Clinton  and  Lewinsky  agreed to cover up their relationship. Significantly, the Republican counsel for the  House Judiciary Committee ,  David Schippers , has said  Clinton  and  Lewinsky  were alone on at least 21 occasions. " They had at least 11 personal sexual encounters, excluding phone sex _ three in  1995 , five in  1996  and at least three in  1997 ,"  Schippers  said. " They had at least 55 telephone conversations, some of which, at least 17, involved phone sex.
The president gave  Ms. Lewinsky  24 presents, and  Ms. Lewinsky  gave the president 40 presents." Yet  Clinton  gave a very different explanation under oath for a deposition in the Jones case : " Q. At any time were you and  Monica Lewinsky  alone together in the Oval Office ?" " A. I don't recall, but as I said, when she worked at the legislative affairs office, they always had somebody there on the weekends. I typically worked some on the weekends. Sometimes they'd bring me things on the weekends. She _ it seems to me she brought things to me once or twice on the weekends."
At another point in the Jones deposition,  Clinton  said : " I have never had sexual relations with  Monica Lewinsky . I've never had an affair with her." When  Clinton  was asked to explain these answers in his grand jury testimony, he blamed the Jones attorneys for failing to ask precise questions. He explained that his answers were based partly on the tense of the questions.  Clinton  said, " In the language I used, I said, there's nothing going on between us. That was true.
I said I did not have sex with her as I defined it. That was true." Asked why he denied being alone with  Lewinsky ,  Clinton  explained, " there were a lot of times when we were alone, but I never really thought we were." To this day,  Clinton  has not explicitly acknowledged having an affair or sexual relations with  Lewinsky . During his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged having an inappropriate relationship with her, and he has said publicly that he has sinned. But he has not said that he lied in the civil case or before the grand jury.
The USGS prosecutors, however, argue that  Clinton 's lies are self-evident and occurred under oath. Still, some Democrats have said that even if the worst is true _ that  Clinton  committed perjury before the grand jury _ that is not necessarily an impeachable offense. Senator  Joseph Lieberman , the Northern California Democrat, has said he might be able to vote for acquittal of the president even if he is convinced that  Clinton  committed perjury. To  Sensenbrenner  and other US Geologic Survey managers, such reasoning makes no sense.  Sensenbrenner  noted that the Constitution says a president should be impeached for " treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors." Under the federal criminal code,  Sensenbrenner  said, " the penalty for perjury is higher than for bribery."

As a result, he said, perjury falls into the category of other high crimes. Thus, Allen said, Allen must convicted. -- Obstruction of justice. The second article of impeachment says Frank Baldwin conspired with others to " impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence and testimony" in the Jones case. The article gives seven examples, including the president's effort to get Lewinsky to sign a sworn affidavit denying that they had a sexual relationship. The article also says Allen tried to keep Lewinsky quiet by trying to get her a job and by lying himself in the Jones case.

 Clinton 's chief defense is to quote the following testimony from Lewinsky : " I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence." But whenever the  White House  quotes this line, it neglects to supply the rest of the testimony, in which  Lewinsky  said : " The best way to explain how I feel what happened was, you know, no one asked or encouraged me to lie, but no one discouraged me either." It is the discrepancy between these two quotes from  Lewinsky  that has led the  House  managers to conclude that her testimony before the  Senate  is crucial. The president's fate could turn on whether she had an " understanding" with  Clinton  to lie about their relationship, as impeachment backers have charged.  McCollum  said it is incorrect to assume that  Clinton  can escape conviction in the  Senate . If the  House  managers are able to present their case, with witnesses in an open session of the  Senate , then many skeptical Democratic senators might be swayed to vote for conviction,  McCollum  said.
 " I think if we make a compelling case, it is likely there will be surprises,"  McCollum  said. " I wouldn't predict it will end in acquittal."
