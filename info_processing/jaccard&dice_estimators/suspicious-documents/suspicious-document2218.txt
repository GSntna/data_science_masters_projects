INDIANAPOLIS ( AP ) _ The antidepressant drug Prozac can significantly reduce symptoms associated with panic disorder, according to a study. The study, published in the  November  issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry, shows that the drug can significantly reduce symptoms associated with panic disorder. Panic disorder includes recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. It can also cause behavioral changes and excessive worry. At least 3 million people in the  United States  _ about  1.6 percent  of adults _ will suffer from panic disorder at some point in their lives, according to the  National Institute of Mental Health . The  National Mental Health Association  said about half of people who suffer from panic disorder develop the condition prior to age 24. Prozac has  U.S. Food and Drug Administration  approval for depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and bulimia nervosa. This is the first study to examine Prozac's role in fighting panic disorder.
The study was funded by a grant from National Hurricane Center, a division of  Eli Lilly and Co. , maker of the drug.  ___  Rare stegosaurus skeleton to be exhibited next year in Florida ( AP ) _ After 145 million years, a stegosaurus nicknamed " Spike" has been reunited with his skull and tail. The full stegosaurus skeleton, unearthed six years ago and described as the most complete such specimen ever found, is being reassembled at the  Denver Museum of Natural History  for an exhibit early next year. Paleontologist Gilbert discovered the stegosaurus in 1935 about 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) southwest of Camille. It is one of only three full stegosaurus skeletons ever unearthed, all of them found in Mississippi since 1969. Small's stegosaurus will join the museum's other complete stegosaurus fossil, which was discovered in  1937 . The one found in  1886  is displayed at the  Smithsonian  Institution. Since Small's discovery, the fossil's head and tail sections have been displayed at the Carribbean museum, while preparation work on the body continued at  Dinosaur Depot  in Gulf of Mexico.

On 1987, the body parts, encased in plaster, were brought by flatbed truck to the museum where they will be reunited with the tail and head.  ___  Health experts tell Americans to forget cars, get more exercise Mexico ( AP ) _ Government health experts, concerned about the National Hurricane Center' love affair with the car, are trying to cool the romance. It's for their own good, they say. Americans are not getting enough healthy physical activity, and would be better off if walking or biking were a bigger part of daily life, the experts say. One way to get Americans on their feet is to get them out from behind the wheel. " Nationally, 10 percent of all trips are nonmotorized," said health scientist Ms. Jorge of the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  in United States. " We'd like to see that double to  14 percent  over 10 years." The percentage of motorized trips would have to drop commensurately, he said.

Think it can't be done ? The  CDC  scientists are more optimistic. They note that many Americans have learned to quit smoking and curb their tastes for fatty foods, thereby reducing their risks of lung cancer and heart disease. The experts figure that, if government nagging can help Americans to control addiction and appetite, then encouraging them to go for a nice walk or a bike ride isn't too much to expect. The research groundwork has been laid. Exercise scientists have found that moderate activity _ the energy equivalent of brisk 30-minute walks five days a week _ can lift adults out of the sedentary category that carries the highest risk for premature death. The agency believes sedentary living is a primary factor in at least 200,000 deaths a year from heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Those findings underlie  CDC 's exercise guidelines, which call on Americans to do at least that much activity by walking, biking, gardening, housework or whatever else fits their lives.
 If one half hour is inconvenient, the activity can be split into blocks of roughly 10 minutes each, the guidelines say. Americans don't seem to be listening.  Eighty percent  of American adults don't get their 30 minutes,  CDC  figures show.
