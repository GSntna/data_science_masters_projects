 NEW YORK  _ Federal prosecutors charged  Wednesday  that the  American Embassy  in  Tanzania  was attacked by at least six men who detonated a bomb packed with car batteries and oxygen tanks, apparently to enhance the lethal force of the explosion. One of the bombers died in the assault, which killed 11 people and wounded more than 80, while another photographed the destruction before fleeing, prosecutors asserted in a new indictment returned  Wednesday . The indictment provides the first detailed account of the bombing on  Aug. 7  of the  American Embassy  in  Dar es Salaam ,  Tanzania . It accuses five men of conspiring with  Osama bin Laden , the  Saudi  exile who is suspected of organizing the simultaneous bomb attacks on the embassies in  Tanzania  and  Kenya  as well as other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. All five of the new suspects are at large, authorities said, and each faces charges for which he could, if eventually convicted, face the death penalty in the  United States . The government announced rewards of up to  $ 5 million  each for information leading to the arrest or capture of the new suspects, matching a similar amount being offered in the case of bin Laden and two other associates.
The indictment brings to 14 the number of men known to have been charged by federal prosecutors in their investigation of the embassy bombings and bin  Laden 's global organization. Four of those are in custody in  New York  and two others are awaiting extradition from  Germany  and  Britain . " Today's charges reaffirm the mutual and unrelenting resolve of  Tanzania  and  Kenya  and American authorities to find, apprehend and prosecute every single person who participated in the murderous terrorist bombings in  East Africa ,"  Mary Jo White , the  U.S.  attorney in  Manhattan , said at a news conference. Prosecutors did not charge the two men who are being held in  Tanzania  in connection with the bombing. One of those men,  Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed , walked into the American embassy late last year and warned authorities about a plot to blow up the embassy in  Nairobi . American officials have declined to say why they are not seeking his extradition.
The government has previously charged bin Laden and associates with the bombing in Tunis, but until now has provided few details. Previous indictments in the case have been much more expansive about the bombing of the United States embassy, which left more than 200 dead and thousands injured. In the latest indictment, prosecutors suggest the two attacks were coordinated so as to occur almost simultaneously in the two countries, under the supervision of members of bin PLO's group. For example, the indictment describes a meeting between one of the suspects in the United States attack, Yasser Arafat, an Egyptian in his early 20s, and  Mohamed Sadeek Odeh , who has since been arrested and charged in the  Kenya  attack. It says they discussed a fatwa, or religious opinion, in which bin Laden called for attacks against Americans. In April,  Fadhil  and another suspect in  Tanzania  rented a villa in  Dar es Salaam , which became the " bomb factory," prosecutors charged..

Around that time, the indictment says, Yasser Arafat and other Kenya-based operatives were preparing in that country for the attack in United States. In Tuesday and April 16, the indictment says, the suspects in United States bought a April 18th PLO Atlas truck to carry the bomb to the embassy, and a white State Department, in which the suspects would flee. The suspects arranged for welding and other mechanical work to be done on the truck, apparently to equip it to carry the bomb, the indictment says. They also were said to have bought oxygen and acetylene tanks and two large truck batteries. Experts say these are typically used to augment the ignition and explosion of a bomb.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) On  Aug. 5 , two days before the bombings, one of the conspirators in  Tanzania  telephoned a counterpart in  Nairobi , the indictment says. Suspects in each country fled just before the bombings occurred, it says. On  Aug. 6 , for example, the night before the attacks,  Odeh  flew on  Pakistani International Airways  Flight ( NU ) 746 to  Karachi ,  Pakistan , along with one of the suspects who helped to prepare the  Tanzania  attack, the indictment says. It says the men left on instructions from other members of bin  Laden 's group. On  Aug. 7 , a man described only as " Ahmed the German" detonated the explosive device in  Dar es Salaam , which was being carried in the  Nissan  Atlas truck along with the tanks and batteries. He died in the explosion.
 Minutes later, another operative who was riding in the  Suzuki Samurai  photographed the embassy ruins as he left the scene, the indictment said. In addition to  Fadhil , the other four men charged  Wednesday  were two Tanzanians,  Khalfan Khamis Mohamed  and  Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , each 24, and two Kenyans,  Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam , 22, and  Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan , 29.
