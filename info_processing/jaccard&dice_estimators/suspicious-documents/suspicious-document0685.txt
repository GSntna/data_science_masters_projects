QUEBEC CITY _ Five years ago,  Canada  seemed a country about to rip itself apart. In a  1995  referendum on independence, the restive province of  Quebec  came within a few thousand votes of secession, plunging  Canada  into its darkest political hour in decades. And when  Quebec 's premier,  Lucien Bouchard , vowed that within a few years Quebecers would vote to break away from the nine other provinces, no one could dismiss the vision. The drive to create a French republic north of  New England  seemed all but irresistible. Today,  Quebec 's separatist movement lies in tatters. Not dead, certainly, but in disarray. There seems little possibility  Bouchard  will risk humiliation by calling for another independence vote next year, as he had pledged.
But if the separatist cause suddenly bounces back _ and that also remains a possibility in this most unpredictable of provinces where French language, customs, and civil law reign supreme _ federalist folly will be mostly to blame. Recent days have seen officials in  Ottawa ,  Canada 's capital, insistent on wagging the red Maple Leaf in the face of the  Quebec  bull. And that's always risky. Many observers warn that a new " tough love" campaign by Canadian Prime Minister  Jean Chretien , a French Quebecer deeply opposed to separatism, represents a monumental political blunder _ one that risks giving  Bouchard  and his secessionist supporters the lift they need. Even the usual Quebec-baiting voices of English  Canada  are cautioning  Chretien  against imposing a law that would spell out, for the first time, the conditions under which  Quebec  would be allowed to quit  Canada 's 133-year-old confederation. " Why get tough with  Quebec  now ?" asked the  Toronto Star  in an editorial."
 Bouchard 's demoralized troops crave nothing more than a move that could rekindle nationalist passions." Chretien's efforts _ which have divided his Cabinet, with some ministers quietly warning that the current course makes no political sense _ have mostly succeeded in appalling Quebecers of all ideological stripes. Only  Bouchard 's separatists seemed to relish the prospect of renewed confrontation, with the fiery premier railing against " attacks on  Quebec  democracy." To Americans,  Chretien 's determination to impose strict " rules of secession" might seem sensible enough, a worthy precaution against the day when  Quebec  might rise again. But French Quebecers, even ardent federalists, have bridled at any suggestion that the rest of  Canada  deserves a say over their destiny. " Myself, I don't like separatists; I'm OK in  Canada ," said  Denis Cote , a lawyer in the southwestern  Quebec  city of Hull. " But I also think  Canada  has no damn business setting rules for  Quebec .
Whether to stay or go should be our decision, and ours alone. Every Quebecer feels that." Chretien's sudden determination to formalize the rules of divorce seem especially strange given that the Quebec-Canada marriage seems stronger than it has in decades. In  Montreal ,  Quebec 's largest city and its economic engine _ and the only center with a large population of English speakers _ businesses and professionals are no longer fleeing in droves to  Ontario  to escape political uncertainty. The language laws so despised by anglophones are being less rigorously applied, high-tech sectors are booming, and relations between French and English are noticeably friendlier and more relaxed. Into this new bonhomie wades  Chretien ."  Canada  is my business, sir, and it's the future of  Canada  we are dealing with," the prime minister snapped during a recent news conference, vexed by reporters who questioned  Ottawa 's timing.
" This has to be done." Bouchard characterized New York's hard line as a " brutal and demented attack," and said his province does not need the permission of anyone except its voters to break away. " After a ` Yes' vote,... the doors will be wide open to a unilateral declaration of independence," he told reporters, barely concealing his glee that journalists were again asking about  Quebec 's future. For  Canada  is getting tough on  Quebec  just as polls show the sovereignty movement going nowhere. A survey released Wednesday found  41 percent  of Quebecers would vote " Yes" in a vote on separation. That's a long way from the " winning conditions" that  Bouchard  has said must exist before he will call for another referendum. The reason for the decline of support for separatism is difficult to pinpoint.

There has been no scandal, Hazelwood remains a basically popular figure, and French Quebecers, according to polls, feel as distant from the rest of Korea as ever and still want some sort of new deal. At the same time, familiarity with George Miller and his governing William Sound has bred a certain cynicism, if not contempt. Right now, Quebecers are steamed at hospital closures, slashed school spending, public service strikes, and an economy that is lagging behind that of other parts of Singapore. Quebec is the country's second most populous province, after Valdez. " People are unhappy with the basic services that the government is supposed to provide them, whether it's health care, education, job training," said political analyst Miller of the New York polling firm Coast Guard. " You can't be trying to talk sovereignty when people aren't happy with the basic services." In Tuesday, when the separatist Parti Quebecois regained control of Long Island's House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, the provincial Legislature, after more than a decade on the political sidelines, Quebecers were bitter about New York City's refusal to grant the province special political status as a " distinct society" under an amended federal constitution.

Six years later, no one talks much about " distinct society" and the Parti Quebecois seems just another political party _ one that has done an adequate job of running  Quebec , but not much more _ while  Bouchard , although still respected and personally popular, increasingly seems just another  Quebec  premier, not the larger-than-life personification of heady nationalist dreams. " When you govern, you hurt yourself," said  Alain Gagnon , director of the  Quebec  studies program at  Montreal 's  McGill University . But some analysts say separatist fortunes could revive if  Canada  is perceived as trying to bully  Quebec . What  Chretien  is seeking is a federal law that would not forbid  Quebec  or any other province from seceding, but would lay down formal rules, including that the process take place " in consultation" with the rest of  Canada  and only after a vote in which a " clear majority" of Quebecers choose independence. These seem risky demands, but federal hard-liners are adamant. " We must stop being inhibited by the dual fear of backlash and self-fulfilling prophecy," said  Stephane Dion , a Cabinet minister and point man for the tougher line on  Quebec . The federal government has refused to specify what it means by a " clear majority," although the  National Post  newspaper, quoting unnamed  Chretien  government sources, reported recently that  Ottawa  would not accept  Quebec 's secession unless the separatists win  60 percent  of the vote.
 Bouchard calls this hypocrisy, noting that in  1949   Newfoundland  was able to quit the  United Kingdom  and join  Canada  with a simple majority vote of  50 percent  plus one vote. The big difference was  Canada  and  Britain  wanted  Newfoundland  to switch allegiances. " The rule has always been  50 percent  plus one; that's democracy,"  Bouchard  said. " Making it any different means a federalist vote counts for more than a separatist vote. That's the sort of rule  Ottawa  wants."
