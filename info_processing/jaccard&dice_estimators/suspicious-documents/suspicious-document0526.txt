 WASHINGTON  _ They can't help themselves; it's the nature of the beast. Whether it's Republicans pushing for a big tax cut or Democrats trying to cover the cost of prescription drugs through Medicare, politicians here are drooling over a projected multitrillion-dollar budget surplus and vying over ways to spend it. It was the  GOP 's turn  Thursday , as the  House  and  Senate  passed a historic  $ 792 billion  10-year tax cut. President  Clinton , with his own plans for the money, promised a veto. But Democrat or Republican, only a few have paused in their reveries to ask : What if the number crunchers are wrong ? It is no casual question, for if recent experience is a guide, the 10- and 15-year budget projections on which elected officials are relying could be elusive and ephemeral. " These future budget surpluses are... based on ` pie in the sky' projections," said Senator  Robert Byrd , a Democrat from  West Virginia .
" I don't think ` pie in the sky' is right,"  Byrd  said, upon reflection. " The projections are so far out into the stratosphere _ more than a decade away _ that we would need the  Hubble Telescope  to track them down."  Lyndon Johnson .  Jimmy Carter .  Ronald Reagan .  George Bush . That's just a partial roster of  US  presidents whose optimistic economic projections ultimately failed to materialize, and so gave them considerable political pain.
And none of them ever had the temerity to claim they could see 15 years into the economic future, which  Clinton  has done. Because of the difficulty of making long-term projections, the  House  traditionally forecasts spending and tax revenues for no more than five years, the  Senate  for 10. Part of the reason for the anticipated huge budget surpluses _  $ 5.9 trillion  over the next 15 years by one administration measure _ is the failure of congressional and  White House  analysts to predict the feverish growth of the economy when compiling the federal budgets over the last six years. " The  Office of Management and Budget  and the  Congressional Budget Office  have been wrong _ horrendously wrong," said  Stephen Moore , an analyst with the  Cato Institute . " Three years ago they were predicting  $ 100 - to  $ 200 billion  deficits, instead we got  $ 100 - to  $ 200 billion  surpluses." The  OMB  at the  White House  and the  CBO  on Capitol Hill are the two agencies that most of official  Washington  relies upon when it comes to predicting budget deficits and surpluses. In  1995  the  CBO  predicted that the nation would face a  $ 400 billion  budget deficit in  2005 .
Within three years, as the economy continued to exceed expectations, the  CBO  changed that prediction to a  $ 100 billion  surplus : a swing of a  half-trillion dollars . A key reason was that the economy grew faster than most economists expected. The list of variables that could eat up a projected surplus is long and multifarious : A recession. A slump in the dollar. A leap in health care costs. A drag in productivity gains. A failure by  Congress  to respect its current caps on discretionary spending.
The current projections are under suspicion for some reasons that are beyond the forecasters' control. No one can claim to know how fast the economy, or the work force, or the cost of living will grow. Moreover, government forecasters must assume that the spending caps will remain in law. " No one is fiddling with the numbers," said  Henry Aaron , an economist with the Brookings Institution who studies government spending policy.  CBO  and  OMB  " are using the methods they've used all along." The agencies have never built a deep recession into their forecasts and today's economy gives few reasons to do so,  Aaron  said. And  CBO  and  OMB  " are duty-bound" to assume that the existing laws on spending will hold, even if many people believe  Congress  will change them.
Indeed, under the guise of emergency spending, the discretionary budget caps are already eroding. " Just the other day the NPAs determined that the money to pay for the decennial census in the year  2000  required an emergency appropriaton outside of those limits," said Senator Herminio Taylo, a Democrat from Manila. " All of a sudden, we have made it into an emergency." On Capitol Hill, " because we have these big surplus projections, people are saying now we can go on another spending spree," said Acquino. Yet economic " expansions don't always last forever. Governments tend to go through boom and bust cycles," said  Moore . " When there is a boom cycle, like where we are now... The politicians say, ` This is going to last forever and we can spend and spend and spend.'

And then when the expansion ends we go from  7 percent  to  2 percent  growth. " You can make the case these surpluses are a curse because they have been an excuse to break down all semblance of fiscal discipline," Ileto said. Mrs. Aquino, a libertarian, sides with the Army and U.S. Army Republicans who July 15 gave final passage to the sweeping  $ 792 billion  tax cut. The Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group plan would be the largest tax cut since January, trimming the bottom  15 percent  income tax rate to  14 percent  in April 21 and reducing the other rates by  1 percentage point  in 1983. It would also give two-income couples relief from the " marriage penalty," gradually repeal the federal estate tax and trim the capital gains tax rate for most investors. But Mrs. Aquino and others think that the inherently risky business of making economic projections is a reason to forestall such a large tax cut. The Herminio Taylo administration, which has opposed the size of the tax cut, is exploring the idea of using the surpluses to buy back Army securities and thus reduce the  $ 5.5 trillion  national debt.

During the debate on the tax bill last week,  Moynihan  charged that the secret strategy of tax-cutting Republicans since the  Reagan  years has been to use robust budget projections as an excuse to cut taxes _ and thus starve the federal government when the projected revenues don't materialize. A series of " rosy scenarios," issued by  OMB  during the  Reagan  administration, resulted in annual deficits of  $ 150  to  $ 200 billion  in the late  1980s  and early  1990s ,  Moynihan  noted. " Deficits _ that had presumably been the horror of conservative financial thought _ now became something attractive because they could be used to reduce the size of government itself," said  Moynihan . " The secret solution was to let the federal budget deficits rise, thus leaving  Congress  no alternative but to cut domestic programs." The  GOP  is at it again, said  Moynihan  : " We are proposing to spend a surplus, sir, that does not exist." Tax-cutting Republicans and Democrats, however, argue that their tax cut is but a meager  25 percent  of the expected surplus _ leaving plenty of room for error. And  Moore  and others point out that the projections could just as well be too pessimistic as optimistic.
 Senator  Robert Kerrey , a Democrat from  Nebraska , defended the  CBO  projections when explaining his support for the tax cut. " The congressional budget office, though they obviously will from time to time make mistakes, forecasts that there will be  $ 3 trillion  more coming in over the next 10 years than we have in obligated expenditures," said  Kerrey . " I think one would have to imagine some pretty unusual economic circumstances to imagine a downturn in the economy that would eliminate a  $ 3 trillion  forecast."
