 WASHINGTON  _ Even President  Clinton  concedes that he did not tell the truth about his relationship with  Monica Lewinsky . But did he commit perjury under the definition of the law ? The vote in the  House of Representatives  over whether to impeach  Clinton  could turn on how this question is answered. The consensus of Republicans in  Congress  is that he clearly perjured himself, and many say it is the charge on which they are most confident they can muster a majority for impeachment. " That is where the evidence is most compelling," said Rep.  Charles Canady ,  R-Fla. , a member of the  House Judiciary Committee . " That will be the major focus" of articles of impeachment,  Canady  added.
Many Democrats say that even if the president did lie under oath about a sexual relationship, it is insufficient grounds for impeachment. At  Tuesday 's committee hearing, some offered a new line of defense, saying Republicans had failed to prove that  Clinton  had perjured himself. Republicans had called the hearing to emphasize that perjury is an important crime. The federal perjury laws require prosecutors to prove that offenders " knowingly" lied under oath and that the lies were " material" to the cases in which the false testimony was given. Lawyers for  Clinton  and some Democrats at  Tuesday 's hearing maintain that he did not commit perjury because his sworn statements, however misleading, were literally true on all important matters. They said that either he believed his denials to be true, testified that he could not recall something or had recollections at odds with other witnesses. At worst, they said, this would be misleading, but not deliberately false.
In his public address on  Aug. 17 ,  Clinton  conceded that he did have a relationship with  Ms. Lewinsky  that was inappropriate and wrong and that his statements about it had been misleading. But the president also said his answers in a deposition in the  Paula Jones  case last  January , when he denied having sexual relations with  Ms. Lewinsky , were " legally accurate."  The Supreme Court  has held that intentionally misleading statements do not amount to perjury. In a  1973  case (  Bronston vs. United States  ), the court ruled that perjury had not occurred when this testimony was given under oath by a witness who maintained a Swiss bank account for five years but closed it : Q. Do you have any bank accounts in  Switzerland  ? A. No, sir. Q. Have you ever ? A. The company had an account there for about six months.
Republicans working on drafting articles of impeachment say say they are generally following the lines established by the independent counsel  Kenneth Starr . In his report to  Congress ,  Starr  cited these five instances when, he maintained, the president had lied under oath : 1. In his deposition in the Jones lawsuit,  Clinton  denied he had engaged in a sexual affair, a sexual relationship or sexual relations with  Ms. Lewinsky .2. He made similar denials to the federal grand jury.3. In the civil deposition, he said he could not remember being alone in the  White House  with  Ms. Lewinsky  or giving her presents.4. In the deposition, he said he had not had a detailed conversation with  Ms. Lewinsky  about her testimony in the Jones lawsuit.5. In the deposition, he said he did not remember whether his friend  Vernon Jordan Jr.  had talked with  Ms. Lewinsky  about the  Jones  case.
 Clinton 's critics agree that the strongest cases can be made in the first three. The facts in these cases are not in dispute, only the interpretation. Here are the details : 1. When the president gave his deposition in the Jones case on  Jan. 17 , this definition of " sexual relations" was agreed on : " A person engages in ` sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person... ` Contact' means intentional touching, either directly or through clothing."  Clinton  was asked : " Have you ever had sexual relations with  Monica Lewinsky , as that term is defined ?" He replied : " I have never had sexual relations with  Monica Lewinsky ."  Ms. Lewinsky  told the federal grand jury about 10 encounters she had with  Clinton  that involved intimate contact but not intercourse.
In his grand jury testimony, he took the view that his statement in the deposition had been accurate because sexual relations occurred only with sexual intercourse. As for oral sex, he said, " If the deponent is the person who has oral sex performed on him, then the contact is... not with anything on that list but with the lips of another person." 2. When  Clinton  went before the grand jury on  Aug. 17 , prosecutors bore in on the question of whether he had touched  Ms. Lewinsky  in the designated areas. This was one exchange : Q. If  Monica Lewinsky  says that while you were in the  Oval Office  area you touched her breasts, would she be lying ? A. That is not my recollection. My recollection is that I did not have sexual relations with  Ms. Lewinsky .
After some back-and-forth, the questioning continued, as follows : Q. So touching in your view then and now _ the person being deposed touching or kissing the breast of another person would fall within the definition ? A. That's correct, sir. And moments later, there was this exchange : A. You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not have sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined. Q. Including touching her breast, kissing her breast, touching her genitalia ? A. That's correct. ( STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) 3.
 Ms. Lewinsky  testified that she was alone with  Clinton  in the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior many times. The president himself told the grand jury that he " was alone with  Ms. Lewinsky  on certain occasions in early last September and once in early  1997 ." He also acknowledged to the grand jury that he and  Ms. Lewinsky  had exchanged gifts, a fact corroborated by considerable evidence. That contradicted his answers to questions in his sworn deposition in the Jones case about being alone with  Ms. Lewinsky . In the deposition,  Clinton  claimed a lack of memory. This was one exchange : Q. At any time, were you and  Monica Lewinsky  together in the Forest Service ? A. I don't recall.

The president went on to say that they might have been alone incidentally when she brought papers to him to sign or dropped off material. Asked whether they had been alone in the hallway where Charles Philpot said some of the sexual encounters occurred,  Clinton  responded : " I don't believe so, unless we were walking back to the back dining room with the pizza. I just don't remember. I don't believe we were alone in the hallway, no." On the question of gifts, he had this exchange with the Jones lawyers : Q. Have you ever given any gifts to  Monica Lewinsky  ? A. I don't recall. Do you know what they were ? Q. A hat pin ?

A. I don't remember. But I certainly could have. Q. A book about  Walt Whitman  ? A. I give people a lot of gifts, and when people are around, I give a lot of things I have at the  White House  away. So I could have given her a gift, but I don't remember a specific gift. Many people can read these questions and answers without concluding that  Clinton  lied. But that does not mean, under law, that he committed perjury.
