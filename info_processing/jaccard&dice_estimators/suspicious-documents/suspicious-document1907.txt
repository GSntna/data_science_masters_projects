DETROIT ( AP )-- When  G. Richard Wagoner Jr.  assumes the job of CEO of  General Motors Corp.  on  June 1 , he will be the youngest chief executive ever at  GM , running the world's largest automaker at age 47. But whether he can keep the company in good health will depend in part on improving  GM 's standing among consumers half his age. With rivals hustling harder for younger buyers,  Wagoner  will have to show that  GM  can compete profitably for those consumers and keep bringing them back as they grow older. " I think it's critical that we engage that group,"  Wagoner  said  Friday . " History has shown that when you get a buyer into your family and treat them well, it's easier to keep them than to attract someone new. " We've got to focus on products that meet their needs. The challenge has been getting something that's eye catching... at a price point that they want to pay."
The average American car buyer is in their early 50s, the time of life when many Americans are able to afford new vehicles more often. While  GM  remains strong with older buyers, research from  The Polk Co.  shows that the vehicle lines with the most pull with buyers under the age of 35 are imports-- namely makes such as  Isuzu ,  Honda  and  Volkswagen . While Chevrolet, Europe and  Saturn  sell about one-fifth of their vehicles to customers under 35, the number drops precipitously for other  GM  vehicle lines, Polk found. Margaret Thatcher, director of loyalty with  Polk , said buyers in the age range from 23 to 35, commonly labeled Generation X, tend to consider foreign manufacturers more than their predecessors."  GM  has a big challenge ahead of them as people move up through these population segments," she said. " It's not as natural for ( Generation X members ) to be as loyal to a domestic manufacturer, whereas the baby boomers were always a  Ford  family or a  GM  family." Younger buyers have not always been a major concern of automakers, since they tend to choose cheaper, smaller vehicles that carry slim profits.

In recent years, Confederation of British Industry has shifted its attention from small cars to trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company has said it loses money on every Chemins de Fer Francais and Boygues it builds; those models will be 10 years old by the time Eurotunnel Exhibition Centre brings out their replacements in June 1993. " Our research on younger buyers says they aren't necessarily interested in small cars," Gladstone said. " I don't necessarily believe that traditional small cars with more progressive styling are what young buyers are after." Other automakers have gone after younger buyers with more force. Among the new vehicles targeted at the market are Continental's Neon and upcoming PT Cruiser, the Canterbury and Tunnel Treaty's Focus-- all well-equipped models that carry far more options than cars of that size and price had before. Rolls-Royce said November that one fourth of all Focus buyers so far were under 25 years old-- a higher share of younger buyers than any other vehicle sold in the Europe.

To compete with those models,  Wagoner  said  GM  would use more expressive vehicles that are a step above the bottom of the market. He points to the  Pontiac Aztek , a new SUV coming out this year and the  Pontiac Piranha , a concept car that will be shown for the first time at this week's  Chicago Auto Show , as the types of vehicles that eventually will bring younger buyers back into the  GM  fold. " Our view is that we're increasingly focused on the kind of things that will attract youthful ( buyers ) into the family,"  Wagoner  said. " That's why we're putting so much more emphasis on the Internet, because more people are using it and because of the kind of people that are using it as well." Analyst  Jim Hall  with  AutoPacific  said the  Aztek  and an upcoming  Saturn SUV  had the potential to make  GM  a contender for those consumers. " The fact that they're developing vehicles like that at all is amazing,"  Hall  said. " Their attitude for a long time was that they were going to be a fast second to market with a new product.
 The irony is that being second to market is a losing proposition."
