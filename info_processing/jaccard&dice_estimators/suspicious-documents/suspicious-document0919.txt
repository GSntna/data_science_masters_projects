A rally in Richmond, Virginia on Saturday against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) drew only 115 demonstrators and lasted only an hour. The participants, mostly supporters of Ross Perot and union members, said they wanted to send the message to Virginia's three wavering congressmen that a "yes" vote on NAFTA in the House on Wednesday would be "remembered in November." Of Virginia's 11 congressmen three have announced as anti-NAFTA, five in favor, and three are undecided. One of the anti-NAFTA organizers complained that President Clinton was buying off undecided congressmen with promises of projects in their districts.

We cover the talks and fold in results from Saturday's separate meetings between VIRGINIA and Virginia. Negotiators in both sessions are facing a Wednesday deadline, which they have virtually no chance of meeting. The states must agree to an extension of the talks by next week, or throw the issue into the North American Free Trade Agreement. ( Nafta, Richmond Journal-Constitution ). 18.
