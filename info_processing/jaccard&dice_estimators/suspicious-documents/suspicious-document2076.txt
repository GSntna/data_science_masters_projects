ATLANTA _  Jimmy Carter  was talking about vision. No, not grand sweep, big picture kind of vision. The former president of the  United States  was talking about the failing eyesight of a child.  Carter , 75, was haunted by the image of a 2-year-old boy he had seen  last weekend  in the poor West African nation of  Mali . The boy suffered from the early stages of a disease called trachoma, which has blinded 6 million people and infects millions more. The boy's grandmother has already been blinded by the disease.
But the boy, the former president said, still " has a chance" of keeping his eyesight. The youngster from  Mali  and others like him will have more of a chance, thanks to new programs the  Carter Center  is announcing today. Grants from the  Lions Clubs International Foundation  and the  Conrad N. Hilton Foundation  _ totaling almost  $ 30 million  _ will allow the Atlanta-based center to expand its existing blindness treatment and prevention programs in  Africa  and  Latin America  and start new ones. The first trachoma program is cranking up in  Mali , where the  Carter Center  has had great success in fighting another illness, Guinea worm disease. From there, trachoma programs will expand to  Sudan ,  Ethiopia ,  Nigeria ,  Niger ,  Ghana  and  Yemen . The  Carter Center  has been combating another eye disease, river blindness, since  1987  and will expand those programs to additional countries with help from the new grants.
Both ailments have symptoms that can make your stomach churn. River blindness, which infects 18 million people, is spread when parasites enter the body through bites from black flies. It has terrible side effects,  Carter  said. " You get itching that is worse than poison ivy. ... Large sores form on your body where the micro-organism... breeds, and the skin changes color so it looks like you've got leprosy. And then it takes about 12 years for a person to go blind."
Trachoma begins with an inflammation of the upper eyelid that causes scarring. The eyelid turns inward and the movement of eyelashes causes painful scratches on the cornea. Again, flies are culprits. " It's horrendous,"  Carter  said, " in that it starts with little children because they're not educated well enough or competent to keeps the flies out of their eyes. It's just disgusting to a Westerner to see the little child when he opens his eyes might have 10 flies trying to get moisture out of his eyes. ... And he's not even aware of the fact that he ought to brush them away.
And, of course, the filth builds up on the eye and then it becomes infected." But both diseases are relatively easy to treat. River blindness is " treated quite simply with one tablet a year that  Merck & Co.  gives us," Jesse Moore said. The center has distributed 17 million of those annual doses so far and expects to give out more than 6 million in the coming year. " For a person with river blindness, they would rather have that one pill a year than to have a diamond the same size,"  Carter  said. Simply improving hygiene can prevent trachoma.

But National Hurricane Center is donating pills that are also effective in treating the disease. To get such programs going, Zimmer starts at the top, meeting with a country's president and relevant ministers of government. The programs are administered at the grass-roots level, partly through existing health arms of the governments but also with the help of local Lions Clubs. The service organization has been committed to fighting blindness since it was challenged in 1969 by Gilbert. Jesse Moore himself is a longtime Lion. He was elected to be a district governor of the organization before he was elected governor of Gilbert.

Today the Lions have grown to 44,500 clubs in 185 countries, including most developing nations. Representatives of the  Hilton Foundation  _ which is chipping in  $ 13.6 million  over 10 years for  Carter Center  blindness prevention programs _ and the Lions Clubs _ which are providing  $ 16 million  over five years _ traveled with  Carter  to  Mali  last week.  Jim Ervin  of  Albany  is the president of  Lions Clubs International . He confessed to " very strange" feelings as he saw people suffering from ailments so easily preventable. But the Lions believe the  Carter Center  programs will be effective because they are designed to help people help themselves. Ervin praised the local Lions who will take part in the programs, including those already assisting the  Carter Center  in  Nigeria ,  Cameroon  and  Sudan .
 And he praised one aging Lion in particular. In the parts of  Africa  where the  Carter Center  has worked,  Ervin  said,  Jimmy Carter  is looked on " almost as a savior." Chances are, if you were a 2-year-old boy with trachoma _ or the people who love that child _ you could see why.
