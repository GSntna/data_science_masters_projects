 BOSTON  _ In a major victory for home schoolers that also serves as a warning to school districts statewide,  Massachusetts ' highest court  Wednesday  ruled that Lynn school officials have no right to visit parent's homes to see how they teach their children. Capping a seven-year lawsuit over parents' rights to teach children any way they choose, the ruling comes at a critical time for home schoolers : As their numbers have quadrupled in the last decade to an estimated 4,500 statewide, hundreds of families are struggling to understand their rights in vaguely written laws and court rulings. Lynn will not appeal the decision and the new school superintendent said  Wednesday  the district had already begun to revamp the policy before the  Supreme Judicial Court  ruled. " Still, this ruling definitely clears the air for school districts," said  Lynn  superintendent  James Mazareas , who took office in  August . The district originally pursued the case because " Six or seven years ago this was uncharted territory," he said. The case stretches back to  1991 , when  Stephen  and  Lois Pustell  filed a suit against the  Lynn School Committee  because the board required home schoolers to be periodically observed by school officials.
In  1994 ,  Michael  and  Virginia Brunelle  faced criminal charges in the same city when they objected to home visits and refused to submit their educational plans to Lynn officials. While the criminal charges were dropped, the Brunelles, Pustells and their attorneys challenged the validity of  Lynn 's policy first in the federal courts and then in the state courts during the past three years. Meanwhile, both couples, each with five children, continued teaching their children at home rather than sending them to school. " We're just thrilled with the decision," said  Stephen Pustell , 44, a computer analyst,  Wednesday . The city's job " is to know that children are being educated, not to educate them." The court did not rule on the constitutionality of visiting home schoolers and instead relied on a much simplier argument : there is no state law that says school districts can require home visits.
The court also re-emphasized parents' long-standing rights to educate their children in the best way they see fit. " It's a big victory with national significance," said Bauer, a lawyer from the  Virginia-based Home School Legal Defense Association , who represented the parents. " Home school laws are in constant flux. If this decision would have gone the other way, we think there would have been copycat school districts all over the country." While  Lynn  is considered the only school district in the country to have required home visits, some school districts statewide have had the requirement on their books, but did not enforce it. Some districts that did not have the requirement would ask parents for home visits.

Many times parents, unsure of their rights, agreed to allow inspectors into their homes. " This ruling will help clarify things," said Mr James Skinner, president of Bishop of Oxford, publisher of a magazine about home schooling. " There are a lot of people who don't want to report they home school because of the vagueness" of regulations. State law does allow local boards to monitor home schooling. Most school systems require some type of documentation _ portfolios of student work, assurances that students are being taught the full school year, or proof of lesson plans. April 11, some school districts said they welcomed the Bauer House of Lords decision to give them guidance.

" The law is very vague... it's been difficult," said  Lois Sullivan  of the  Cambridge Public Schools . While home visits can be part of an agreement between a home schooler and the district, it is never required, she said, adding, " This will help us." While flatly rejecting the inclusion of home visits as a mandatory right of school board's oversight, the  SJC  left the door open for home visits in cases where a child may be failing educationally, or if other families send their children to a neighbor for schooling. But the  SJC  said there was no valid reason to consider home visits essential today to meet the state goal of ensuring all children are being properly educated. " Teaching methods may be less formalized, but in the home setting may be more effective,"  Greaney  wrote. While not directly endorsing the home schooling movement, the court said officials need to trust that parents who choose home school over public school are capable of educating their children _ although it many be in a different way than a public school.
 " We doubt that parents like the ( Brunelles and Pustells ), who are so committed to home education that they are willing to forgo the public schools, and devote substantial time and energy to their children, will let the children's progress suffer for lack of adequate instructional space," he wrote.
