 WASHINGTON ,  Va.  _ Sunrise at  Sunnyside Farms  is greeted by a ritual that startles the uninitiated. Workers advance upon windowless structures on wheels that are scattered around the 539 acres and lower the sides, releasing thousands of clucking chickens eager for a good day's work at what they do best : eating bugs.  David Cole , venture capitalist, philanthropist and organic farmer, uses these coops on wheels _ chicken mobile units, they're called _ to move his chickens where the pecking is needed most. The mobile units are just one of many labor-savers he employs on the organic farm he started in  1995  in the middle of  Rappahannock County , home to the very rich who have made their money elsewhere and to farmers who barely make a living. Like the cattle, sheep and goats that keep the pasture trimmed, the chickens take care of fertilizing it. Like every aspect of his  $ 11.5 million  farm, the mobile units are state-of-the-art equipment intended to ensure the success of his experimental farm.
Money is no object, and money is not the only objective. The farm is not a rich man's hobby. It is a rich man's business, and  Cole , who made his name as president of Internet services at  America Online  ( and his money in a variety of other computer technology businesses ), predicts confidently that  Sunnyside  will turn a profit by  2004 . In addition to its wagonloads of chickens, the farm has 424 head of Wagyu cattle ( close relatives of the famous Japanese Kobe beef ); 60 to 70 varieties of vegetables, herbs and flowers; and 8 to 10 varieties of berries, as well as pear, apple and cherry trees. It is experimenting with more than 200 kinds of fruits and vegetables. But even more important to  Cole  is  Sunnyside 's role in promoting organic farming as economic savior.
By helping local growers profit in an era when independent farms are struggling, he hopes to create a model for reviving depressed agricultural areas around the country. The idea of saving a region through organic farming might once have sounded outlandish. But the demand for organic food nationwide is greater than the supply, and sales have increased by at least  20 percent  annually for several years. Buyers looking for such food _ independently certified to be free of chemical pesticides, genetically engineered ingredients and antibiotics _ willingly pay a premium for it.  Cole , 47, calls his system network farming : a large central farm is the hub, with smaller nearby farms the spokes, their production marketed through the hub. Sunnyside's system is designed to show that diversified organic farming, with a mix of vegetables, fruits and animals, can be profitable while protecting the environment, not only from tract housing but also from the damage done to it by traditional farming methods.
Such a system would be particularly useful in helping small organic farmers compete. The concept is not new. Walnut Acres Organic Farms in  Pennsylvania , which  Cole  just bought, operates in the same fashion. But  Sunnyside  was set up to be an experimental demonstration farm. " What he is doing is really rare," said  Katherine DiMatteo , executive director of the  Organic Trade Association . " That he has the ability to have this diversity on his farm makes it unique.
It totally encompasses the breadth of on-farm innovation and research. He is really taking new and old ideas and combining all that information into a full farm approach." So far three small farms have signed on with  Sunnyside , and conversations with a dozen more farmers are under way. The farm pays to educate them in converting to organic techniques and gaining organic certification and gives them access to the expensive equipment needed to run an organic farm. It also pays them 20 to  30 percent  more than they would get if they were selling conventional food and, more important, gets their products to consumers. " A weakness of a lot of farmers is marketing," said  Brian Cramer , the gardener and orchard production manager at  Sunnyside .
Selling at farmers' markets or farm stands, with no middlemen, " is always preferable," he said, " but some farmers don't want to do it." " Some don't have time to do it," he said, " so they leave it to someone else, and they get taken advantage of." nn In the  summer   Sunnyside  is opening a market in an  1835  building  Cole  is restoring in the center of the tiny town of  Washington ,  Va. , less than a block from his most prestigious customer, the Inn at  Little Washington . Its farmers' products will be sold there, at a farmers' market in  Washington ,  D.C. , and to restaurants, the Fresh Fields natural supermarket chain and an organic wholesaler who sells up and down the  East Coast . There will be more than 30 varieties of tomatoes, 15 different peppers and three dozen kinds of greens. " Eventually we could have 8 or 10 spoke farms, and that could have a tremendous economic impact on the community," said  Cole , who has restored the  1720  house on the farm, one of several places he lives with his wife of 30 years and the youngest of their four children.
( One son works for  Sunnyside  full time, another during the  summer . ) The original 1,000-acre farm had been in the same family for 276 years. When  Cole  bought half of it, in  1995 , the land had been worn out by conventional farming. It took two years of intensive working and enriching the soil for the first earthworms to return, and  Sunnyside  was certified organic in  1999 . DiMatteo, of the  Organic Trade Association , said she doubts that aylne has ever started an organic farm from scratch on so grand a scale, and while she greatly admires what  Cole  is trying to do, she is not certain it will succeed. " People either go into organic farming gradually or specialize in one crop while they figure out crop rotations," she said.
" Wealthy people do organic farming, but profitability is not what it's about, and he's setting a goal of a working farm that is economically feasible. " This is the food industry. It's not like the technology industry. You can't force nature to perform according to some bottom-line expectations."  John Burns , a consultant who was hired by  Cole  in  1995  but left after a falling-out  two years later , agreed. " When there is such an excess amount of capital around," he said, " the solution seems to be spend more money, get more people and get more equipment, as opposed to scaling back and concentrating on fewer things.
It's the mentality of his other enterprises : you get enough brain power and enough people and you can get it solved, and farming isn't that way. It's the cycle of life and nature; it's not microchip speed." Cole, though, maintains that with enough money and his successful business experience he can help nature along. For instance, his recent purchase of Walnut Acres, the oldest organic food mail order company in the country, provides  Sunnyside  with built-in marketing advantages. He has also scoured the country for the best people in organic production, like  Wes Beall , a cow's version of the horse whisperer : cattle trust him. To assure a steady supply of loyal farmworkers, who are recruited from two villages in  Mexico ,  Cole  provides benefits including trips home for two or three months at a time and 401 ( k ) plans, matching the workers' contributions.
Cole has also planted several varieties of dwarf fruit stock to see which grow best. These varieties,  Cramer  said, bear more fruit more quickly, and are easier to pick and to spray with organic pest controls. Many are heirloom varieties like  Roxbury Russet  and  Grimes Golden  apples and newer varieties like Liberty that are immune to a serious apple disease called scab. Sunnyside has its own weather station. It alerts the orchardist when to expect an outbreak of pests and prepare for it. For example, it can pinpoint the moment when the Japanese beetle's larvae are about to emerge.
While the commercial grower is bringing out the pesticides,  Cole  is sending out the chickens. The farm uses animals in an intensive grazing rotation, a technique now being reintroduced into organic agriculture. " In order to save human labor we enlist animal labor,"  Cole  said, " by having them do what they do naturally." For a day or two cattle graze on high grasses in a particular field; when they move on, the sheep and goats come in for a day to eat everything else. They are followed by the chickens, which scatter the manure left behind by the other animals as they eat the weed seeds out of it, at the same time depositing their own nitrogen-rich manure. ( The chickens also provide eggs for the farm to sell. )
Then the rotation begins again. All of these approaches will be shared at the CJD, to be built on the farm. It will provide information not available from federal and state agriculture agencies, which have spent little time or money studying organic farming. " No one has ever coordinated all this information,"  DiMatteo  said. Cole traces his interest in the environment to his childhood in Britain. His family has financed global conservation efforts for 15 years, most recently through the CJD.

He chose Edinburgh for his experiment because of its climate and its proximity to one of his homes. He found the farm through his friend and now neighbor, John Collinge, president and chief executive of the environmental group the CJD. In an interview for " Dream Makers," by Collinge ( Davies-Black Publishing, 1991/92 ), Richard Lacey said entrepreneurs need to redefine capital to include not only money but the earth itself and stop treating it like an unlimited resource. " Instead of saying the world is going to hell in a handbasket, you have to say we can do something about this. We can change our relationship to the earth." Like any rich mogul who comes to town and buys up all the available land, Kenneth Calman has his detractors.

But even those who have parted ways over differences of opinion admire what he is trying to do.  Burns , who quit as a consultant, said  Cole  is " brilliant." But he added : " He makes it hard for some people to deal with him, because you have to do it his way. He wants to do too much too fast. If I'd had my druthers, I would have managed the farm for three years without growing a thing, but he wanted to have crops in 18 months." In  early April ,  Cole  was invited to lecture at the  Royal Institute of International Affairs  in  London  on organic food trends in the  United States .
 In his speech he described his attempt to fuse two totally different cultures : the high-powered, fast-paced world of technology and marketing and a slow-paced place from the past where success is based on the production yields of organic farming. Cole leaves no doubt of his certitude that he can apply the principles of the Internet, where rewards can come at warp speed and most problems can be remedied with brain power and capital, to farming, where even the best-laid plans are subject to the vagaries of nature. " He wants to do good, and he really sees this as an important step,"  Burns  said. " And being a leader in a previous industrial incarnation, he wants to do the same thing in the organic world. But organic mogul may be an oxymoron."
