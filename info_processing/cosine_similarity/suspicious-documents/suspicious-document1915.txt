FORT WORTH,  Texas  _ By the end of  September , the warnings will be up on billboards all over this  Texas  city : " Gun Crime Means Hard Time." In  Richmond , Va, the signs carry this message : " An Illegal Gun Gets You Five Years in Federal Prison." In  Rochester ,  N.Y. , you might read a similar warning on the side of a city bus : " You ( plus ) illegal gun ( equals ) federal prison." Behind the tough messages is a new approach to curbing gun violence that is being adopted by cities around the country, where officials are eager to duplicate the apparent success of  Richmond 's 2-year-old " Project Exile." Criminals who ignore the advertised warnings and tote guns face tough, specialized federal prosecution instead of getting lost in the overwhelmed state courts. In each city, they're selling a promise that if you're caught carrying a weapon in the commission of a crime, the local authorities will turn you over to the feds, who will use existing law to seek out the longest sentence applicable for your offense. A convicted felon caught with a gun or anyone caught carrying a gun while trafficking in drugs will usually draw at least five years in a federal penitentiary.
In the federal system, repeat offenders get more time, federal prisoners serve about  80 percent  of their sentences and there is no parole. " There's been a sea change in the criminal community," says  James  B.Com ey, criminal division chief in  Richmond 's  U.S.  attorney's office. " The bad guys say exactly the same thing : ` Hey man, nobody's carrying any more. That thing will get you five years." Richmond had the second-highest murder rate in the country in  1997 , the year they mounted  Project Exile . They ended the year with 140 homicides, but by the end of  1998  that number had dropped to 94. The city has recorded only 47 homicides through the first eight months of this year, as compared to 67 for the same time period last year.
" I tell you what it's done,"  Comey  said."  Richmond  was a demoralized city, not just in the folks who live here but in the police department. " Exile gets more credit than it deserves some times, but it's fired up the cops and fired up the citizens,"  Comey  said. " We are doing something. We are becoming a zero-tolerance city for guns." Because the program doesn't require new gun laws, and is not gun control in the traditional sense, even the  National Rifle Association  is supporting Project Exile. That makes it a rare animal _ a gun program that President  Clinton ,  Sarah Brady  and the  NRA  can agree on.
" I wish ( the  Clinton  administration ) backed this more than the lip service they've given it," said  NRA  spokesman Bill Powers. " Call it whatever you want, but whatever effort goes after armed violent felons on the streets of American cities is something the  NRA  backs heartily." Civic leaders are desperate to reduce gun violence in their communities. Even though the murder rate has fallen dramatically in most major cities in recent years, traveling to  Richmond  to study  Project Exile  is becoming a civic leader's pilgrimage to Mecca. " There really isn't any rocket science to doing a lot of gun cases," says  Comey . " The genius to Exile is the advertising, because what that has done is sell fear to the potential defendants in ways we never imagined. " It really almost creates a myth in  Richmond ,"  Comey  said.
" The advertising people said, ` Look, we manipulate culture.' They said, ` Give us a chance to sell fear." Word of mouth has been important, too,  Comey  said. " Bug  Smith  was a legendary shooter in  Richmond . We popped him with a single gun and he got 16 1/2 years in the fed. When the word got out that Bug  Smith  got 16 1/2 years on a gun, the reaction was just phenomenal." Comey quickly agrees there are other factors at play in  Richmond  that may have affected the murder rate.
For instance,  Virginia  abolished parole in  1994 , which means the first wave of criminals put away since then are probably not yet back on the streets. And the drug trade in his city has shifted away from crack cocaine to heroin, which produces less volatile behavior,  Comey  said. But all the decreases in homicides in  Richmond  have been in the category of murders by firearm. And there's been a nearly identical drop in armed robberies. " Those two clues tell me something has happened in the firearm world of bad guys in  Richmond ,"  Comey  said. But the approach has its critics. Three  U.S.  District judges have lambasted Project Exile for crossing the line " into a sovereign state's area of authority and responsibility."
Federal prosecution also costs considerably more than state prosecution of similar cases. And in  Richmond , criminal attorney  David Baugh  charges that  Project Exile  violates the civil rights of  Richmond 's black residents by sending them in front of federal juries drawn from a larger, predominantly white pool. Federal officials point out, however, that most Project Exile offenders will never see a jury, opting to plea bargain. The 10th Amendment to the constitution was written to make sure the federal government did not intrude upon those responsibilities held by the states,  Baugh  said, " And now we have every case, and it's momma being handled by the feds. The federal courts are overcrowded anyway _ judges who are supposed to be handling the most delicate cases are now doing the equivalent of traffic cases."  Fort Worth 's " Operation Safe City" will work much like  Richmond 's program, as a cooperative approach among the local police department, the  Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms, and the  U.S.  attorney's office. On a recent afternoon,  ATF  agent  Mike Russell  delivered his pitch for the program to more than 100 of  Fort Worth 's  Neighborhood Police Officers .
He made it clear that the gun cases will be prosecuted strictly off the arrest reports filed by the local police. " The success of this program is directly proportional to getting these guys prosecuted in the federal system,"  Russell  said. " It's a gimme, folks. The  U.S.  attorney doesn't want cases where we have to come back and interview people. These cases will be made strictly off the reports you file." Their best chance for making a gun case stick is at the point of executing the search warrant, he said, advising them to write down as much detail as possible about where the gun was found and any comments the suspect makes about the gun. " They may not tell you about the dope,"  Russell  said.
But the gun ? " You're not the gun police, we are,"  Russell  said. " You talk to them then and they'll probably tell you anything you want to know." Several  Fort Worth  officers immediately began asking questions about using the program to get people off the streets who are problems in their neighborhoods. When  Russell  got back to his office, he had a handful of telephone messages from officers who had specific cases they wanted to pass on for federal prosecution. Russell has been operating something of a one-man " Safe  City U.S.A. " program for the  past 18 months , wading through  Fort Worth Police Department  offense reports and pursuing those gun cases he thought he could make stick. Russell picked up one gun case from an offense report on a man arrested for multiple traffic warrants.
A patrol officer spotted a motorcycle parked between two houses in a residential neighborhood late at night, and saw a shortened, pistol-grip shotgun strapped to the bike. The officer ran the motorcycle's license tag number, and discovered the outstanding traffic warrants. The officer arrested  Nicholas Alexander Martin  when he returned to the bike a few minutes later, dressed in black, a bandolier of shotgun shells strapped to his chest. He was also carrying a flashlight, four feet of telephone cord, a four-inch lock-blade knife and white surgical gloves. There was a ski mask in his pocket. " We picked up the ( gun ) case, and he turned out to be a multiconvicted felon in possession of a firearm,"  Russell  said. Martin got 17 1/2 years in the federal penitentiary.
 David Montague , a spokesman in the  Tarrant County District Attorney 's office, said  Martin  probably would have been allowed to plead guilty to 10 years or less had the case stayed in the state system. And with good time and parole, he would serve even less. " The reality is that in the state courts, we have so many murders, armed robberies, child abusers and sex offenders that it's unlikely he would have the maximum,"  Montague  said. When the  Safe City  program formally kicks off at the end of the month,  Russell  will be aided by six other USDA agents in researching gun cases for prosecution. " When this thing gets rolling, we're talking about volume," he said. Volume has been a problem in  Richmond , where federal prosecutors saw their felony caseload jump from about 139 in 1988 to 404 in 1988 as a result of Agriculture Department. The  Justice Department  is requesting an additional  $ 5 million  from  Congress  to fund about 45 to 50 prosecutors to help with the increased gun enforcement through a variety of programs.

The Illinois is lobbying USDA for $28,899 to implement Project Exile or something like it in every major city. In Minnesota, the public relations campaign designed to make criminals leave their guns at home is being financed by local businessmen Gerald W. Whittaker and Montana. North Dakota is not reeling under its homicide rate. In 1988, considered the city's worst year for violent crime, there were 195 homicides. But by 1987 there were only 64, and South Dakota's violent crime rate dropped more in the past two years than Wisconsin's under Congress. " What better time than when life is good ?" said Midwest assistant Great Plains Attorney  Terry Moore .

" I came to the  U.S.  attorney's office from the district attorney's office. I was the gang queen. I didn't try anything but murders and capital murders. It was all guns. " I'm excited about bearing down on criminals with guns because I don't want to go back to those days,"  Moore  said. " If I can take a gun away from one criminal and one person doesn't get shot or killed, man, I feel great ! How do you measure that ?"
