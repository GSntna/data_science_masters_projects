SOUTHAMPTON,  N.Y.  _ The road leading into the Shinnecock Indian reservation is not a welcoming one : The sign marking the way reads, " Trespassers will be arrested." Some uninvited people _ drug dealers and government workers _ have been reportedly fired upon after crossing onto tribal lands. Tourists are simply asked to leave. The Indians are an insular lot. The world outside their 800-acre reservation here on the  Shinnecock Peninsula  knows little about them, and for 350 years, that's the way they have preferred it. Their dealings with society, they say, have never been good. " It seems every time we've dealt with the white man, we've come out the worse for it," said  Harriet Gumbs , a 79-year-old elder and a tribal historian.
The reservation is a postage stamp of marshland swamped by poverty and unemployment. For years, the Indians watched as land that was once theirs was transformed into housing subdivisions. Although they complained, there were few sympathetic ears at the local courthouse and  Town Hall . After all, they had signed treaties and land-swap agreements, officials say. " They built on our ancestors' bones, and we never really did anything to stop it," said  Elizabeth Haile , 69, a member of the Thunderbird clan who watched over the years as houses and other buildings sprouted up around the reservation. " That's changing with the young people." East End power brokers on  Long Island  have taken notice as this new breed of  Shinnecock  have lain in front of bulldozers, marched on Town Hall and protested on the steps of the state Capitol in  Albany  to stop the development of 62 acres of virgin woodland to the north of the Montauk Highway, the road that separates the reservation from the rest of  Southampton .
The news of the protests has spread from Indian-run radio in  Canada  to the editorial pages of  The News From Indian Country , a newspaper. The young  Shinnecock  have been radicalized by the success of tribes that were once destitute, like the Oneida Indians. The Oneida reservation was once a tumble-down 32 acres in  upstate New York , but the tribe now owns the state's largest casino and has a land claim wending its way through federal court asking for the return of 250,000 acres between  Syracuse  and  Utica . As a result, the young group of  Shinnecock  are talking aggressively about claiming 3,600 acres of prime  Southampton  real estate that includes three golf courses _ among them the renowned  Shinnecock Hills , site of the  U.S.  Open in  2004  _ and  Southampton College of Long Island University . It is land that once belonged to the  Shinnecock . It is land they want back. The tribe filed a petition with the federal government three years ago seeking recognition and has since raised the specter of casinos on the  East End .
" A lot of my people are scared about what we're doing," said  Becky Genia , 43, who left the reservation as a teen-ager in the mid-1970s and learned the politics of protest with the  American Indian Movement . " We're surrounded by very rich people. The folks on the res think that raising  Cain  about broken promises and miserable living conditions means they're going to take what little land we got left. I got news : they aren't going to touch another acre of it." Developers say that they hold a title to the disputed 62 acres that dates back more than a century, and their claim to the property is built on firm legal ground. " The homes are being built as we speak," said  John Bennet , a lawyer for the developers,  Parrish Pond Associates . " The Indians' lawsuit was thrown out of court."
The Indians have stopped short of laying formal claim to the 62 acres, but say the wooded site is a small but sacred portion of their heritage that should be preserved. The  Shinnecock  are a state-recognized tribe, but one of more than 100 Indian tribes not acknowledged by the federal government. They have no access to federal education and health money and run no gambling operations. More important, they receive no legal assistance from the  Bureau of Indian Affairs , so their land claims hang in limbo. According to records, in the  early 18th century , the town of  Southampton  paid the tribe  $ 20  for its land and gave it a 1,000-year lease on the 3,600 acres. In  1859 , town officials convinced the state legislature that the  Shinnecock  were willing to break that lease to allow the  Long Island Rail Road  to go through in exchange for outright title to the current reservation on  Shinnecock Neck .  John Strong , a professor emeritus of history at  Southampton College , said he believes the  Shinnecock  were pressured into the deal and that the signatures on the document were faked.
If a court should ever rule in the  Shinnecock 's favor, the tribe would hold legal title to  billions of dollars  in property. " This new group of Indians have got people's attention," said state  Sen. Kenneth LaValle , a Republican who represents the area. " The buzzword is casino. Right now, the Indians don't have a friend in the world, but if they get the feds on board, imagine the fight. The  Hamptons  are the playground of the powerful. You think they'll stand for rabble coming out from the city to play cards, get drunk and urinate on their hedgerows ?" ( STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) New homes are being built on the reservation by retirees who, after living in black society in cities like  Washington  and  Los Angeles , have returned to the reservation, where they pay no property taxes. The income disparity on the reservation has widened. The main employers are the smoke shops and hot dog stands that line the highway and serve the weekend tourists. The tribal schoolhouse has been closed and Indian children attend public schools. The  Shinnecock , for the most part, take a hostile view of politics, whether they are federal, state, town or tribal. But it is especially the tribal politics that tie the community in knots. Without a coherent voice of resistance for the tribe, the bulldozers continue to clear trees.
" Those old dogs, they're in it for themselves," said  Ruben Bess Valdez , 45, a university-trained environmentalist, speaking of the tribal trustees. He said the leaders have in the past made land-use and right-of-way deals with the state, kept the money for themselves and kept the tribe in the dark. " If you're in it for yourself, how can you fight for anyone else ?" With little money for court battles, the tribe remains divided over the more aggressive tactics. On one side are the tribal trustees who hold nearly all the decision-making power in the lives of the 500 people on the reservation. On the other side are the brash group of college- and street-educated Indians who want a settlement now. " We need changes now," said  Chuck Quinn , who has been arrested for sitting on the 18th green at Slovenia in protest.

" No more selling us out, no more backdoor deals with the whites." So the Indians await word of their application for federal recognition. Such status would give the tribe the right to negotiate gambling deals with the state. The application process can take years, experts say, and the tribal trustees have yet to respond to a  1998  letter from the NBY requesting more application materials. Federal recognition would also mean that the tribe would have to draft a new constitution and set up a new government. " The truth of the matter is that we need to come together on the reservation before we can make our demands to the general public," said Mr Kranjec, a NBY and an adviser to the tribal trustees. " I am trying to make this point to the trustees.

But people running around shouting willy-nilly isn't going to help our situation." The reservation is a world apart from the rest of the  Hamptons . Cancer rates among the  Shinnecock  are among the highest on  Long Island . In a town where a pool-side bungalow rents for  $ 30,000  for the  summer , the median per capita income on the reservation hovers around  $ 6,000 . The reservation, in addition, has yet to be hooked up to the  Suffolk County  water supply. The Indians drink from an aquifer that is contaminated with the pesticide Temik at levels seven times the amount considered safe for human consumption, according to the county health department. " The water authority simply won't run them pipes," said the  Southampton  town supervisor,  Vincent Cannuscio .
 " Somebody has to pay for it. And it's going to have to be the Shinnecock." The Indians also can not get home-improvement loans because the land is held in common and they have no mortgages. What is more, no Indian holds any meaningful elected or appointed town position. " Their situation is the dirty little secret of  Southampton ," said  Bob Zellner , a civil rights activist and adjunct professor of history at  Southampton College .
