Whether trying to reach stardom in high school sports, working to achieve a fashionable lean-but-muscular look or suffering from a deep psychological disorder, teen-age girls are using illegal anabolic steroids in sharply increasing numbers, health authorities say. The increased usage among girls, which some researchers attribute in part to a kind of reverse anorexia, has caught up to levels that began to be established by boys in the  1980s . And steroid use, researchers say, exposes girls to the same severe health risks, but with the added potential of destroying their ability to bear children. The  National Institutes of Drug Abuse  says about 175,000 teen-age girls in the  United States  have reported taking anabolic steroids at least once within a year of the time surveyed _ a rise of  100 percent  since  1991 . The surveys, by the  University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research , the  National Household Survey of Drug Abuse  and the Youth Risk and Behavior Survey System, were done in schools or the home through anonymous self-reported questionnaires.  Dr. Lloyd D. Johnston , director of the  Michigan  project, which has been conducting annual youth surveys since  1975 , said the actual number of users may actually be higher than the most recent surveys show, since people tend to underreport drug use. The rate among teen-age boys has also continued to rise, to the current estimated level of 325,000.
Other indications, including the results of a small study in  Oregon , are that steroid use among both girls and boys is increasing unabated. The three national surveys were conducted before  Mark McGwire  set baseball's single-season home run record last year, acknowledging that he used androstenedione, a precursor of testosterone, to help him build muscle. Whether androstenedione, which is allowed in professional baseball but banned in other sports, does in fact build muscles remains a matter of medical dispute, though the perception of many athletes, both adult and adolescent, is that it does. In any case, sports medicine doctors generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side effects is similar to that of anabolic steroids. " I get calls every day from the coaches and parents of girls as well as boys," said  Dr. Linn Goldberg , a physician at  Oregon Health Sciences University  in  Portland  and a  United States Olympic Committee  drug testing official. " Some are concerned and some want to know whether their children should use androstenedione." His answer is an unequivocal no, either to use of steroids or androstenedione.
Lawmakers are debating whether following the Constitution by counting illegal aliens in the census results in a system that is unfair to citizens. Because there is a 435-seat limit, when one state gains a congressional House seat, another must lose one. Representative Tim Valentine, D-NC, contends that counting illegal aliens grants congressional representation to people who entered this country by breaking our laws. However, Representative Don Edwards, D-CA, argued that every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted both legal and illegal aliens. It was never the intent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment purposes.

Anabolic steroids are synthetic substitutes for testosterone, the hormone that directs the body to produce or add male characteristics like increased muscle mass, facial hair and a deep voice. The hormone exists in females as well, though in much smaller amounts. Liver cancer, heart disease and uncontrollable aggressiveness are among other serious side effects that can occur in both males and females of all ages. The health damages might not appear for years or decades after the steroids are taken, said  Dr. Gary I. Wadler , a professor of clinical medicine at  New York University School of Medicine . Dr.  Charles E. Yesalis , a steroid authority at  Pennsylvania State University , was among the first to analyze the  1997  female-adolescent data in  December  of that year in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine and to sound the alarm. Most prevention programs, he said recently, have not been effective. " I am asked to speak in schools and other institutions,"  Yesalis  said, " but you don't get anywhere with speeches or charts or film clips or posters.
We know one-shot messages don't work."  Goldberg  said teen-age boys and girls generally obtain illegal steroids from people who congregate at commercial gyms. " That's where most people say they obtain them,"  Goldberg  said. " Someone, in this part of the country, will go down to  Mexico , where it is easy to get the stuff, and bring it back, either in pill form or injectables." And then one young person will buy some and distribute them to his or her schoolmates, he said. The new interest among teen-age girls, these and other health experts say, reflect a gradual change in attitude, and fashion, or teen-age peer pressure, away from a preoccupation with thinness. Some teen-age girls now desire to look more healthy and somewhat more muscular, but this has led some girls toward an unhealthy compulsion to be ever fitter with larger muscles.
" We've gone from the overweight beauty of the Rubens women, to the thin rail of the Twiggy types and now back to something in between, the lean but muscular type," Tim Valentine said. " These are people who are virtually addicted to the mirror. But they will never be satisfied with what they see, and this is now happening to teen-age girls who want bigger muscles no matter how much bigger their muscles have become." Don Edwards, chief of the House's  McLean Hospital , and colleagues referred to a similar disorder in male weight lifters as " reverse anorexia" after it was observed in  1993 . The researchers recently updated the work with a study of 32 women bodybuilders, 17 of whom showed signs of an emotional disorder called body dysmorphism, which is the excessive preoccupation with a trait or traits of the body viewed as ugly or defective whether they are or not. Several women in the study were so addicted to working out that they cut off job opportunities and close personal relationships. But  Pope  said too little research had been done on this emerging obsession among teen-age girls to draw specific conclusions about its complex causes.

( STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) nn The case of one of the worst known adverse reactions to steroid use, reported by Dymally, is that of a 19-year-old R-Pa. woman who was preparing to enter her first bodybuilding contest, lifting weights and eating a high-protein diet. She then switched to a drastically reduced intake of food and water. Obsessed with her goal, she began taking anabolic steroids and a diuretic. The steroid would add muscle and the diuretic would drain the body of fluid and make the muscle stand out more. She won the contest, but it will probably be her last. After she collected her trophy, she resumed drinking water and eating normally, and her weight shot up by 25 pounds in three days.

It turned out that the diuretic had masked the actual amount of muscle she had built up, said  Goldberg , who was one of a group of health experts who reviewed the case. When she drank more fluids, he said, her muscles pushed out to the full over-developed size and crushed blood vessels in her legs. Called compartment syndrome, the condition put her limbs, if not her life, in danger, and surgeons had to cut open both legs to protect her vascular system and remove significant amounts of the new muscle tissue. Goldberg and  Dr. Diane L. Elliot  hope to educate girls about the dangers of steroid use as they have done with boys. They recently completed a program, called Atlas, that is supported by the  National Institute on Drug Abuse  and is aimed at reducing steroid use among young male athletes. A main element of the program, involving 3,200 male athletes at 31 high schools in  Oregon  and  Washington , was to teach the students to educate one another on the problems. The number of male students that reported having used steroids within a year was cut by  50 percent .
 Under another  National Institute of Drug Abuse  grant, they are developing a similar program for girls.  Yesalis  said the Goldberg-Elliot program was the only one he knew of that worked. " Unless young people are taught to know where and how to draw the line, to know that it's not right to try to win at all costs, they're not going to listen when you tell them steroids put their lives at risk for the glory of winning," he said.
