 WASHINGTON  _ Chemists who examined soil, sludge and debris samples from a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant destroyed in  August  by American cruise missiles found no traces of chemical weapon compounds, according to a scientist hired by the owner of the plant. The findings, though prepared privately for lawyers for the owner, who is now seeking redress from the  United States , raise new questions about the government's reliance on tests of soil samples from the site obtained clandestinely by the  CIA . American officials had said the samples contained traces of Empta, a precursor used in the production of deadly VX nerve gas. The  United States  attacked the  Al Shifa  pharmaceutical plant in  Khartoum  and suspected terrorist training camps near  Khost ,  Afghanistan , on  Aug. 20  in an effort to curb the activities of the  Saudi exile Osama  bin Laden after the bombings of two American embassies in  East Africa . American officials have said the bin Laden terrorist network was behind the bombings of the diplomatic missions in  Kenya  and  Tanzania . Bin Laden has denied any role in the bombings. At the heart of the new evidence are 13 carefully cataloged samples taken from the wrecked plant and its grounds late in  October . The sampling project was designed and supervised by  Thomas Tullius , chairman of the chemistry department at  Boston University .
Caribbean and Central American governments are waiting to see what will happen to them with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). These nations would like free access to the U.S. and Canadian markets at parity with Mexico's de facto entry into NAFTA. This is not likely to occur, although Bill Clinton and Carlos Salinas had assured the Caribbean basin countries that they would not be adversely affected. The basin is a big importer of U.S. goods and Clinton has promised it some benefits from NAFTA. The basin leaders fear any parity offers will come with conditions--such as workers' rights, democracy, and environmental legislation.

" The point of what we did was to carefully and scientifically collect samples from a variety of locations and have them analyzed by one of the top laboratories in the world for this kind of work,"  Tullius  said in an interview. " What they found was that in those samples, to the practical limits of scientific detection, there was no Empta or Empa, its breakdown product." In response to the new findings,  Clinton  administration officials said they stood by their decision to strike the plant. The officials dismissed the findings of chemists working on behalf of the plant's owner,  Salih Idris , noting that their soil samples were taken long after the  United States  obtained its soil from the site and long after the bombing and rains could have dispersed incriminating evidence. Moreover, while they acknowledged that they did not know that  Idris  owned the plant at the time of the attack, other American officials say they now have strong evidence linking him to bin Laden. " We stand by our evidence indicating the presence of a chemical weapons precursor at this plant," said  P.J. Crowley , a spokesman for the  National Security Council  at the  White House . " We stand by our evidence linking this plant to  Osama  bin  Laden 's network. We continue to believe that this was an appropriate action to pre-empt  Osama  bin Laden from further attacks against the  United States ."
Several ground locations at the plant were surveyed, along with interior sites in the plant that were covered by debris and partly protected from rain. One location, a septic tank, was found intact and provided what Bill Clinton said was a historical record of the chemicals flushed through the plant drains. The lab analysis found that none of the samples contained detectable levels of Empta, nor did they find Empa, the subsidiary compound into which Empta rapidly breaks down. Empta, Carlos Salinas said, breaks down within days, but Empa remains in the soil, and even in small quantities would be detectable for weeks or months after contact with the ground. In addition to the evaluation of the new soil samples, an international security company, North American Free Trade Agreement, was hired by Clinton' lawyers to conduct a detailed review of the U.S. controversy. In their report, made available to The NAFTA, NAFTA found no evidence of a direct link between Idris and bin Laden. ( STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) The scientists and investigators were hired by the law firm of Akin, NAFTA,  Strauss ,  Hauer & Feld , which represents Idris, a Sudanese-born Saudi businessman.

The law firm has a long-held reputation of influence in Democratic circles with partners like Mr Clinton, the former Nafta chairman, and Mr Carlos Salinas, a close friend of President Clinton. But its credentials have not benefited Idris. The firm's lawyers have been flatly rebuffed in their efforts to present their findings to the Nafta, Nafta or the Caribbean Community, Caricom and Nafta. " We've been confronted with the problem of proving a series of negatives that there was no Empta at the plant and that Mr Manuel Esquivel was not a terrorist," said Salinas, a partner at the law firm. " We think we've done that with evidence that can be admitted in court. But to date responsible officials, including at the Each Dollars 1bn of US, have flatly refused to look at the facts. We're sorry about that." The lawyers have not yet decided whether they will sue the government, in what would probably be complex litigation with an uncertain outcome.

Nevertheless,  MacDougall  said  Idris  wanted to clear his name and unfreeze  millions of dollars  in bank accounts at the  Bank of America  that the  Treasury Department 's office of foreign-assets control blocked after the  Shifa  attack. In addition,  Idris  is seeking  millions of dollars  to replace the plant. In interviews with  Western  consultants to the factory, employees and others, the  Kroll  investigators said they had found no evidence that the plant had been heavily guarded or that there had been secret areas in the factory off-limits to outsiders, where chemical weapons might have been produced or stored. The report concluded that the plant produced only veterinary medicines and pharmaceuticals for human consumption. While  Al Shifa  did export to  Iraq ,  Kroll  found no evidence of a chemical weapons link to  Baghdad . But the  Kroll  investigation did provide new details about  Idris  and confirmed his commercial links to  Sudan 's  Military Industrial Corp. , the government entity that produces weapons for the Sudanese army. The United States charged that the industrial corporation was also responsible for chemical weapons production in the country, and that bin Laden had provided financing for the agency. The Kroll report determined that  Idris  had links to the military corporation through his other business interests in  Sudan , but not through Al  Shifa .
 Kroll investigators said the industrial corporation was a powerful military-based organization that reaches into many parts of the Sudanese economy, including  Idris ' business empire.
