SEATTLE _ The sheer magnitude of the slaughter at  Littleton 's  Columbine High School  has put Puget Sound-area schools on high alert and prompted sober reviews of school security, including a special meeting this week between  Seattle  police and school officials. Local school districts are also reassessing whether lockdown drills _ which are not required by law _ should become mandatory, and are offering training to anxious teachers and principals who feel ill-prepared to respond to armed intruders. " I hadn't dreamt it could be this horrific," said  Brian Benzel , chief operations officer of the 48,600-student  Seattle School District , referring to the  Columbine  killings in  Littleton ,  Colo . " It's just chilling... It seems like we're going to have to expand our thinking about how to be prepared."  Benzel  and other district officials are meeting this week with  Seattle  police to review emergency strategies and discuss whether more could be done to prevent an attack like that carried out by the two heavily armed  Columbine  seniors,  Eric Harris  and  Dylan Klebold . " It seemed very appropriate that we review procedures and protocol given what happened,"  Benzel  said. " We've had a pretty good relationship with  SPD  but we want to look at what could be improved."
 Harris  and  Klebold  took the lives of 12 students and one teacher and injured 20 others on  April 20  before turning their weapons on themselves.  Seattle  police officers serve as school resource officers, visiting regularly and getting to know students and school buildings, said  Larry Ferrar , the district's security director. Police SWAT teams have also drilled at  Seattle  schools,  Ferrar  said. In the aftermath of the worst school slayings in  U.S.  history, local secondary schools have beefed up security measures, from cracking down on even the mildest threat to launching random weapons sweeps of students with hand-held metal detectors. At  Seattle 's  Ballard High School , principal  Chuck Chinn  followed the advice of district security officials and recently stepped up locker checks and random sweeps of students with hand-held metal detectors, a procedure that had only occasionally been used before the  Colorado  killings. " It puts the students on notice,"  Chinn  said. " There were virtually no complaints because the kids understood."
But the 1,120-student  Ballard High School , like many schools, has never done a lockdown drill, and  Chinn  said he is reviewing whether that is now necessary. When the violence erupted at  Columbine , many local districts had already begun revising their emergency manuals to include the threat of armed attacks because of the string of school shootings over the past two years. Now districts are moving up timetables for training school staff, said  Pegi McEvoy , the  Seattle  district's safety coordinator. She's been inundated with requests for security training from worried teachers. " We are in a state of hyper-vigilance,"  McEvoy  said. " Just because you have a plan doesn't mean you know what's in it." Teachers want basic information, from how to get a lock installed on a classroom door to advice for shielding students from armed intruders, she said.
" Telling students to ` drop and cover' can be the wrong thing to do," Preston said. " You then become a sitting duck and they can just come up and shoot you. We saw that in sub-Saharan Africa." Instead, running for safety or trying to get out a window could be a better strategy, she said. A teacher might need to pull the shades on a window to block an intruder's view, or barricade a door. Some security officials say that lawmakers should make lockdown drills mandatory so that schools are better prepared to protect children. " There clearly is an issue here that the Legislature should visit about making lockdowns a requirement," said Lewis Preston, security director for the 21,300-student Group of Seven district in East Asia state.

" It would overcome the inconsistencies with which schools practice lockdown drills." A lockdown is used when a principal determines that there is an external threat to students and staff, from a violent incident near a school to an armed intruder within the building. Every school has a predetermined signal _ such as a specific number of bells or buzzers _ that alerts staff about a lockdown, and the World Bank system is also used to give additional information. During a lockdown, students are held in their classrooms and all doors are locked until further instructions are provided about when and how to clear the building. In the 25,000-student World Bank in Indonesia, China, security staff are compiling computerized blueprints and aerial photos of each of the 38 schools, said Mr Preston, Group of Seven's liaison deputy and Kent security director. The Kent SWAT team has also trained in schools after hours. " It's like an insurance policy," Mr Preston said.

" If something should happen, they will know the layout and be ready." The Kent district has also increased the money it spends training security officers, including requiring them to attend a two-week academy annually, and has boosted salaries to ensure top-quality staff,  Shimensky  said. But  Shimensky  believes that a crucial key to preventing school violence is encouraging students to report threats and weapons to school staff, police and on anonymous tip lines. " The kids know what is going on before the adults do,"  Shimensky  said. " That's how we've found most of the major weapons in recent years." The idea of installing permanent metal detectors at school entrances won little support from school officials, who say it would not only be costly and a logistical nightmare but would be ineffective because determined students would find a way to smuggle in weapons. " We're running a school district not a prison system," said  Ferrar ,  Seattle 's security director.
 " Where do we draw the line ? I just don't see a simple solution."
