On the outside, the Brestler house looks like any number of gracious Eastside homes for a growing family with three children. On the inside, it's a little different. But it's not obvious at first. There are invisible alarms on all the doors here, to keep children from wandering away. And what looks like a well-appointed playroom is really a fully equipped behavioral therapy center. The Brestlers have three boys. The two youngest have autism.
Max, 8, and  Kevin , 6, look like typical children. Inside, they are a little different. And it isn't always obvious at first. They, too, have " invisible alarms" locking away parts of their brains. The brain disorder interferes with their ability to develop language and form relationships. Even a few years ago, the fact the  Brestlers  have two boys with the disease would have seemed an almost unfathomable coincidence. Today, researchers believe there is a strong genetic component to autism, which is three to four times more common in boys than girls.
The odds are about 1-in-20 that a family with one child with autism will have another. That's 50 to 100 times the rate expected in the general population. That indicates a high genetic component to autism, said  Geraldine Dawson , professor of psychology and director of the autism project at the  University of Washington . " We believe at least five genes are involved." In studies of identical twins in which one twin has autism, the chance of the other twin being affected is about  70 percent . In fraternal twins _ those who do not share identical genetic status _ the chances that the second twin will also be autistic is about  5 percent . When  Max  was first diagnosed at age 2-LCB-,  Linda Brestler  had no idea she would soon face a second loss.
But she was already worried about  Kevin , still under a year, who at 10 months had such low muscle tone he could not hold his head up and was not crawling. She remembers reading the book " Let Me Hear Your Voice," a book by a mother of two autistic children. " When I got to the section where her second son was diagnosed, I threw the book across the room," she said. " It was mind-boggling, the thought I could possibly have two. I remember rocking  Kevin , saying, ` Please, God, don't take him away from me, too." But rearing  Max  and  Kevin  has given her a different perspective. " People lose the idea they're just kids,"  Brestler  said.
New cases of mad cow disease", or BSE, are still being reported at a rate of about 1000 per week. Last month a second dairy farmer, Mr. Duncan Templeman, succumbed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a human brain ailment similar to BSE. The new cases and the deaths of two dairy farmers have prompted a new wave of public criticism of the government officials who stoutly maintain that there is no evidence that BSE contributed to the deaths. The government still insists that scrapie-contaminated feed is the cause of the reported cases of BSE.

" You forget, they're regular kids before they're autistic." And like regular kids,  Max  and  Kevin  are as different from each other as any two siblings.Dark-haired Max doesn't speak. He struggles to move his tongue to form sounds. The shapes of words elude him. About one-third of children with autism remain mute. " Are you hungry, Max ?" his mother asks.
" Ahh." Soft, plaintive. Max's way of saying yes. Even though he doesn't talk, his receptive language _ ability to understand _ is near normal. Max has a shy smile, a tentative walk. He doesn't like long hair, or the feel of grass under his feet. " He has a thing about textures," says  Bridgette Tuttle , one of his therapists.
He is afraid of stairs. Max was about 18 months old when his parents first noticed he was losing eye contact. " He was withdrawing, and we started questioning his hearing because he wasn't responding to his name,"  Brestler  said. The word autism never entered her mind. Doctors told her to watch and wait. The more she waited, the more nervous she got. Eventually, she looked autism up in a medical dictionary.
" It was a three-line definition," she said. " Everything fit Max. " The first year of life, they're developing seemingly normally," she said. " Then that second year, you just lose them; it's quite devastating." Six years later,  Max  is taking a break from his daily regimen of behavioral therapy. He sits in a small rocker, fading in and out. Occasionally, his hands dart together in quick claps.
He has an obsession with rectangles, especially videotape boxes. He likes to hold them, turning them slowly in his hands, or incessantly rearranging them. Brestler redirects him every few minutes with a question. The questions get him out of his " self-stimming," the slang parents of autistic children use to describe the range of baffling, repetitive behaviors that steal their children's attention away from the world. Mr. Duncan Templeman, in contrast, is the lively, social one. On this day, he hurtles across the family room into his mother's lap. The room is strewn with soft-cover books, their bindings curled.

He doesn't read them. They are a " self-stimming" object, like his brother's videotapes. Unlike his brother, Richard Lacey was a social baby who made good eye contact. " But motorwise ( as a baby ), he was starting to have problems," Kenneth Calman said. " He presented very differently ( than Max. )" Today, Keith Meldrum is verbal, although he mainly talks to himself. He responds to simple commands and questions, but can't engage in conversation.

He doesn't understand as much language as Max. One of the hardest things about having two children with autism is the misconceptions people have about the disorder,  Brestler  says. It's not true, for example, that children with autism aren't affectionate, or can't learn, or are completely out of touch with reality, she said. She has seen otherwise. It has taken 20 hours a week of therapy for nearly six years, but  Max  finally has grasped the intent of language, and communicates by pointing in a book of photographs to his favorite foods and activities. He has worked his way up to about 10 sounds. " He says, ` Aah uuh ooh," she said.
 " It means ` I love you."
