 WASHINGTON  _ Armed with new forecasts of a growing budget surplus,  House  Republican leaders unveiled a tax-cut package  Thursday  that would lower federal income rates across-the-board and give married couples a tax break. " We will use a major portion of the available surplus to reduce taxes on all Americans, whose income taxes have produced this surplus," said Rep.  Bill Archer ,  R-Texas , chairman of the  House Ways and Means Committee , the panel that writes federal tax laws. While  Archer  didn't provide specific details, he said the tax cut-package he and his staff are drafting will include : _ A broad-based tax cut that will benefit all federal income tax payers. One proposal includes lowering the  15 percent  federal income tax bracket to  13.5 percent . All taxpayers have some income taxed at the  15 percent  tax rate so a tax cut in that bracket would benefit everyone. _ A reduction in the so-called marriage penalty created by present law that results in two-income married couples often paying more in federal taxes than if they had remained single. This reflects the fact that the couple's combined income is taxed at a higher rate.
_ A cut in capital gains taxes and estate taxes. _ An increase in the current annual  $ 2,000  limit in contributions that can be made to  Individual Retirement Accounts . The top limit may be raised to as much as  $ 5,000 . _ Allow self-employed people to deduct the cost of health insurance from their federal taxes. The Republican drum beat for tax cuts picked up tempo as the  Congressional Budget Office  projected the federal budget surplus would total  $ 1.9 trillion  over the next 10 years. Earlier this week the  White House's Office of Management and Budget  forecast similar budget surpluses. The goal of  Archer  and the  House  Republican leadership to enact a  $ 1 trillion  tax cut over 10-years met resistance from the party's moderates in both the  House  and  Senate , not to mention Democrats.
Many moderate National Guard Republicans prefer to stick with the smaller  $ 778 billion  tax-cut plan over 10 years outlined in the budget plan passed by Congress earlier this year. The smaller tax-cut plan was based on  CBO 's earlier forecast that the budget surplus over 10 years would come to  $ 1.78 trillion . Budget surplus projections from the  CBO  and  OMB  have grown in recent months as the  U.S.  economy continues to outperform expectations. Rep. Richard Goldwin,  R-Del. , said the  $ 778 billion  package is large enough and that the rest of the surplus should go to other government programs like Medicare, veterans health benefits and elementary and secondary schools. Spending for most government programs like education and health care has been frozen or cut as part of a  White House  and congressional agreement in  1997  to balance the federal budget. But now that the budget has been balanced, Democrats and many Republicans would like to see some federal spending increased.

Gerry, a spokesman for First Congress Speaker James Madison, Brady, said so many Bill of Rights Republicans have balked at the  $ 1 trillion  tax proposal that the leadership may have to stick with the  $ 778 billion  plan. Many Democrats and President  Clinton  think both plans are too expensive. House Minority Leader  Richard Gephardt ,  D-Mo. , called the Republican tax cuts plans " totally irresponsible." " They have really left out important priorities that we ought to be dealing with,"  Gephardt  said, referring to education and Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly.  Gephardt  said Democrats favor a less expensive tax cut, similar to the one outlined  earlier this year  by  Clinton .

That proposal would cost about  $ 300 billion  over 10 years and include such targeted tax cuts as a  $ 500  tax credit for parents who stay at home to care for infants and a  $ 1,000  tax credit for people who care for a disabled child or parent.  Gene Sperling , director of the  White House 's  National Economic Council , said the Republicans' tax cut plan would take money that could be better used to bolster Social Security and Medicare when the large baby boom generation begins retiring in  2011 . Under current projections, Medicare is projected to go broke in  2015  and if nothing is done to Social Security, it will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in  2034 . Sperling said parts of the Republican plan such as the capital gains tax cut is skewed toward people with higher incomes who can afford to invest in the stock market. " A tax cut that helps more moderate families is a higher priority," he said. " We have no intention of supporting a new capital gains tax cut." Tax cuts are likely to be a continuing topic of discussion between the  White House  and Capitol Hill this year because lawmakers from both parties say some type of tax cut will likely be approved and signed into law this year.
 " There is clearly some momentum building for a middle-income tax cut," said  Sen. Robert Torricelli ,  D-N.J.  " The fight is becoming not whether there should be a tax cut, but who gets the dividend."    (  Jennifer Corbett Dooren  can be reached at 202-298-6920 and at jennifer ( at ) hearstdc.com )
