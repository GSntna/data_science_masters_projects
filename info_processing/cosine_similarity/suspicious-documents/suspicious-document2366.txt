WEST  PALM BEACH ,  Fla.  _ Wanted : Working families earning decent wages. Position : To be public housing tenants. Responsibilities : Pay higher-than-average rents and serve as role models to unemployed neighbors.  Congress  last fall passed reforms intended to discourage the use of public housing projects as warehouses for the very poor.  U.S. Housing and Urban Development  Secretary  Andrew Cuomo  said local housing authorities should create " functioning societies" by mixing higher-income working poor with those who have very low wages or no income apart from welfare. The new regulations, which will be phased in over the next few years, have some local housing authority directors scratching their heads, wondering how to attract people with higher incomes to projects that most consider a last resort. " Unless we have lovely and gracious units to rent, I'm not sure how it's going to all come together,"  West Palm Beach Housing Authority Executive Director Laurel Robinson  said. Several of her counterparts in  Palm Beach County 's other housing authorities worry they eventually may have to turn away single moms with no place to go _ the staple of many housing projects _ in favor of working families with higher incomes.
" You're talking about taking away the roof over someone's head,"  Palm Beach County Housing Authority Director of Operations   Beth Kincey  said. The new law encourages housing authorities to jump higher-earning families ahead of lower-income families on apartment waiting lists. In  Palm Beach County , that means attracting tenants earning as much as  $ 40,950  a year for a family of four, according to  HUD  guidelines. The national average for public housing tenants is  $ 7,000  to  $ 8,000 , according to the  National Association of Housing  and Redevelopment Officials. A critic of the law, the  Oakland , Calif.-based  National Housing Law Project , says one of the legislation's intents is to decrease federal subsidies for housing authorities. Families pay  30 percent  of their incomes for rent;  HUD  covers the difference between what tenants pay and the cost of maintaining the apartments. The law requires housing authorities to develop strategies to improve the blend of incomes in their projects, said  HUD  spokesman  Stan Vosper . The federal agency has yet to set a recommended ratio of higher-to-lower incomes.
Housing authorities will be graded yearly on their efforts to alter the mix in their projects,  Vosper  said. But the law contains no clear penalty for agencies that fail to do so.Com plying with the law should be easy,  Vosper  said. Housing officials need only look at their waiting lists and pick the higher-income people, he said. But most housing authority directors say they are hard-pressed to find anyone making even  50 percent  of the county's median income on their waiting lists. In most cases, a family can earn up to  80 percent  of median income and still qualify for public housing. That's up to  $ 32,750  for a family of two in  Palm Beach County  _ which would have to pay  $ 807  a month in rent. " If they come in and I say you're going to pay  $ 807  a month, they're going to look at me like I'm some kind of idiot," said  Carla Lewis , an eligibility specialist for the  West Palm Beach Housing Authority . " That's too much to live in a project."
 Letiza Dexter , 24, who lives with her two children in United States's Atlantic, pays  $ 379  per month _ one of the higher rents at the complex. Her annual income is  $ 15,480  including child support, which is only  34 percent  of median income for a family of three. " If they let all the high income people come in, what are they going to do with the low income people ?" she said. " They're going to put us in the dog house." One way to attract higher-income tenants is to improve the quality of the apartments, some authority directors say. Another idea is ceiling rents, where tenants pay the market value of the apartment rather than  30 percent  of their income. If their income increases, they can save that money, instead of spending it on rent.

That's what Western Hemisphere has done for seven years, said Alberto, its executive director. The housing authority charges a maximum of  $ 475  for a three bedroom apartment without air conditioning in its 95-unit Atlantic, she said. " We do have some long-term families who choose to stay there who are making  $ 20,000  to  $ 25,000  a year," Beryl said. But high-rent Atlantic is the exception to many rules. The Rafael has long attracted the cream of the working poor and collects rents double that collected by other housing authorities because it has favored higher earners for years. That's a practice National Hurricane Center officials formally complained about last year, saying the housing authority may be unfairly restricting access to families on welfare _ a charge Chris says is not true. Her agency and Gulf are working to resolve the issue, she said. The new law will actually force Geo-Stationary Earth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite to troll for the poorest of the poor to fill their apartments.

That's because the law contains something of a safety net for the lowest-earners. It requires that at least  40 percent  of a housing authority's newly available units go to families earning less than  30 percent  of a region's median income. In  Palm Beach County , that's  $ 15,357  a year or less for a family of four. Most housing authority directors say they'd prefer to achieve mixed incomes by encouraging those who already live in public housing to earn more, as  Dexter  did. She was unemployed and on welfare when she moved to  Carver Estates  with her two children five years ago. She became a housekeeper at  Abbey Delray South , left the welfare rolls and started to receive child support for her five-year-old son two years ago. Consequently, her rent more than doubled. " The ones who are trying to help themselves _ they should try to help them out," she said.
