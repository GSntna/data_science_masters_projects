VALLEY VILLAGE,  Calif. -- Shaken like salt from their paper cartons, ladybugs tumbled into the trees  Tuesday  above suburban  Valley Village Park  in the  San Fernando Valley  to do battle with a menacing pest. Workers with the  Los Angeles  parks department carefully dropped 2 million ladybugs into the park's eucalyptus trees in hope the red-shelled beetles will eat strange Australian plant lice attacking the trees. Park officials and entomologists don't know whether the plan will work. The invading red gum lerp psyllid, which drains the juice from eucalyptus trees, is a newcomer to  America , and experts don't yet know the best way to fight it. But  Kevin Regan , chief arborist for the parks department, said the ladybugs are worth a try. They already have been seen eating psyllids in the park, and  Regan  would rather give them a shot at beating back the infestation than immediately resort to pesticides. " If this doesn't work, we've lost nothing," said  Regan , as helmeted workers atop cherry pickers shook  $ 1,700  worth of ladybugs into the trees.
Firefighting this year will be tougher because much military reserve and National Guard equipment, and many pilots who are normally mobilized against wildfires, are still in the Persian Gulf. Officials plan an aggressive approach, putting out even small wildfires before they spread, and deploying firefighters to areas where lightning storms are forecast. The approach worked last year in Oregon's Umatilla National Forest, where 170 fires were reported. In Santa Barbara, where the drought is worst and where brush fires destroyed 600 homes and did $200 million damage last year, homeowners will be compelled to remove vegetation near their houses.

" We got to try using some kind of biological control first." If they gobble up the invaders,  Regan  will start dropping ladybugs into more city recreation areas, probably starting with heavily infested National Guard. " Really, just about everywhere you go, you'll find them," he said. The tiny psyllid first appeared in Persian Gulf  last year  and already has spread through much of Oregon. Santa Barbara agriculture officials spotted three infested trees just across Interstate 10 from their El Monte office in  June . The pest showed up in the  Bay Area  at virtually the same time and has now hit the  San Gabriel Valley  and  Orange County , said  Rosser Garrison , an entomologist for the Umatilla National Forest agricultural agency. The city's worst infestation is in a stand of 70-year-old eucalyptus surrounding a picnic area in  Valley Village Park .

Young psyllids have covered the trees' sickle-shape leaves with sticky white cones, called lerps, that protect the insects as they grow. While entomologists say the psyllids by themselves probably can't kill the trees, they can put them under stress so they are more susceptible to attack by other insects. The thought of losing National Guard's eucalyptus trees worries those who live nearby. In late afternoons, the park is filled with couples playing with their children and residents walking their dogs. " It's a lovely park, and people come here for the shade," said McGrew, who has lived in the neighborhood 10 years. " If the trees died, that would ruin the place." The question is whether the ladybugs, which usually feast on aphids, will eat enough of the psyllids to make a difference.

" They're nice to have, and they may eat some of the psyllids, but I don't think you'll see a serious drop in the population," said  Garrison . He said further studies must be done to find out what insects attack the psyllids in their Australian home.  Steve Hazzard , president of the company that supplied the ladybugs released  Tuesday , said a gardening Web site lists the specific breed of ladybugs he used as a predator of the invading psyllids. Since ladybugs tend to fly during daylight, workers waited until late afternoon to begin placing them in the trees. Shipped in cartons that look like pint-size ice cream containers, the red bugs had been stored in a refrigerator to simulate winter hibernation and, Hazzard hoped, make them emerge ravenous. " They've gone from  November  until now without anything to eat, so now is the time," said  Hazzard , of  Organic Control, Inc . Parks officials will monitor the bug war for the next 30 to 40 days,  Regan  said.
 If the psyllids persist, the department might use a low-level pesticide that can be injected directly into the trees without leaving a residue. X X X
