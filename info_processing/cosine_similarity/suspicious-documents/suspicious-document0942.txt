Veterinarians have prescribed it for years for high-priced polo ponies and creaky old dogs. More recently, it's been hyped as a " cure" for human arthritis. But a dietary supplement called glucosamine had been dismissed as quackery by many mainstream doctors. Until now. Earlier this month a respectable long-term European study on glucosamine won a prominent place on the program of the  American College of Rheumatology  meetings in  Boston . And on  September 30 , the  National Institutes of Health  announced it will launch a  $ 6.6 million  study of glucosamine and a similar supplement called chondroitin, one of the most expensive clinical trials ever conducted of any " alternative" therapy. But glucosamine and chondroitin are not the only hot new areas in arthritis. Researchers are paying respectful attention to acupuncture, tai chi, stinging nettle ( it may cut down on the need for conventional painkillers ), and other complementary therapies.
They're also excited about new science-based approaches such as cox-2 inhibitors ( already on the market ) and metalloprotease inhibitors ( still experimental ). Arthritis researchers say they're finally beginning to understand how to attack the most common form of the disabling disease, called osteoarthritis _ the deterioration of the cartilage that cushions each joint, generally causing symptoms after age 45. Currently, 23 million Americans suffer from osteoarthritis _ one in every eight adults. ( Another 2.1 million have rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that strikes younger adults, usually women. ) As the baby boomers enter the osteoarthritis-prone years, the number of sufferers will swell. Nothing except heart disease causes more disability, and no disease robs more people of their ability to walk, climb stairs, and even do something as simple as rise from a sitting position. Fortunately, " there's a lot of progress in osteoarthritis," says rheumatologist  David T. Felson  of  Boston University School of Medicine . " The emerging paradigm is that this is a disease that needs to be treated with multiple approaches."
That includes alternative treatments. Even before the  NIH  study is off the drawing boards, leading US arthritis specialists are recommending glucosamine to their patients _ not as a cure, but as something that reduces pain in some people and may ( or may not ) retard the progress of the disease, depending on whether the European study results can be confirmed. " Try it for 30 days,"  Boston University  rheumatologist  David T. Felson  told 62-year-old  Maureen Palmer  last week at  Boston Veterans Affairs Medical Center , where she is participating in a  BU  study of osteoarthritis. " I'm putting all my patients on this stuff. It's completely safe, and it's worth trying." Palmer, a fifth-grade schoolteacher with a painful right knee, says her primary care doctor was skeptical of glucosamine when she asked about it. " Now I think I'll give it a try," she said. Specialists' open-mindedness about alternative therapies is underscored by a new 286-page " Guide to Alternative Therapies" published by the Arthritis Foundation, a nonprofit research and service organization.
The guide sorts through the scientific evidence ( or lack thereof ) on 80 arthritis nostrums and " healing systems," from Ayurveda and qi gong to copper bracelets and Thunder God Vine. The Arthritis Foundation undertook the project because it was getting 5,000 telephone queries a month about alternative therapies. " We had no position except ` we don't know," says  Dr. William J. Arnold , who chaired the foundation's task force on alternative medicine. To be sure, not all arthritis specialists are receptive to alternative therapies. " To some extent the Arthritis Foundation has given credibility to a lot of things that don't deserve it," complains  Dr. Donald M. Marcus , a  Houston  rheumatologist. Despite lingering skepticism among their colleagues, many arthritis specialists see their field as an emerging model for the marriage of scientific and complementary approaches. On the scientific side, leading researchers paint an expansive picture of the future of osteoarthritis treatment. " We're going to be able to treat the pain better with safer agents.
In the next decade, if not sooner, we'll be able to give you things that will slow the disease," says  Dr. Roland D. Moskowitz  of  Case Western Reserve University of Cleveland . " And we're going to able to resurface joints with biological materials, not only to treat the disease but to repair the damage." Some new approaches come from surprising directions. For instance, there's some evidence that a common antibiotic may slow joint damage or even prevent osteoarthritis. Dr.  Kenneth D. Brandt  of the  University of Indiana  is overseeing a large federally sponsored trial of doxycycline, a synthetic version of the antibiotic tetracycline, in people with osteoarthritis or at high risk for the disease. Tetracyclines inhibit enzymes that soften and break down cartilage. Until recently, researchers thought that osteoarthritis was simply a matter of wear and tear, a grinding down of the slick, elastic cartilage that cushions and lubricates the ends of all bones. Mechanical forces certainly play a role, especially in initiating the damage.
Earlier injury, whether from athletics or repetitive overuse in the workplace, increases the risk for later arthritis by three- to six-fold.  Maureen Palmer 's knee arthritis is the price she's paying for a ski injury nearly 30 years ago. With each step, weight-bearing joints must bear a force equivalent to up to six times total body weight. Thus, it makes sense that there's a strong link between osteoarthritis and excess weight. Overweight individuals have four to five times the risk of osteoarthritis. But mechanical forces do not totally explain osteoarthritis. Overweight individuals have a higher risk of arthritis in the hands too, suggesting that obesity exerts a systemic effect. Inheritance plays a role too, especially in arthritis of the hand.
So do hormones, since women's risk of the disease rises sharply after menopause, when estrogen levels decrease sharply. Diet also affects osteoarthritis, especially once the process has begun. Researchers think this may be due in part to the effects on cartilage from oxidation _ a central mechanism of age-related tissue damage. In a study of participants in the well-known  Framingham Heart Study ,  Felson 's group found those with the highest dietary intake of vitamin C, an antioxidant, had one-third the risk of developing knee pain from arthritis compared to individuals with the lowest vitamin C levels. Vitamin C may also facilitate cartilage repair. Vitamin E, another antioxidant, apparently has less effect on the progression of arthritis, but its anti-inflammatory effects may explain why some studies suggest vitamin E supplements may ease pain in some patients. For now, the best advice specialists can offer to osteoarthritis sufferers is to attack the disease with a combination of lifestyle, medical, and dietary interventions _ and ultimately, joint replacement surgery when all else fails. At the top of the list are weight loss and exercise.
" Even a little weight loss can make a difference," says  Brandt , the  Indiana  arthritis specialist. Framingham data show that a weight loss of 11 pounds in women of medium height reduced the risk of painful knee arthritis by half. Exercise _ especially gentle and progressive resistance exercise that strengthens leg muscles _ is getting increased attention among arthritis researchers. This doesn't mean going to a gym and working out like  Schwarzenegger ; cheap ankle weights or elastic bands, used faithfully at home to do leg-lifting exercises, will do the trick. " It takes very little physical activity to improve fitness," says  Brandt . " Even the very elderly can do it." One reason is that stronger leg muscles brace the knee and hip joints, reducing the wobble that comes with age-related loosening of ligaments. Increased joint stability in turn protects cartilage from the cycle of injury, enzymatic breakdown, and inflammation.

A Orion Telescope Center study presented at the San Jose rheumatology meeting showed a home exercise regimen improved leg strength by  71 percent  and reduced arthritic knee pain by  36 percent . A larger exercise study from Earth showed similar improvements in knee pain and physical function. When painkillers are necessary, doctors often advise the old standby acetaminophen ( Tylenol or generic brands ) if inflammation is not an issue, although users should be cautious about combining this drug with alcohol to avoid liver damage. To relieve both pain and inflammation, the standard recommendation has been non-steroidal anti-inflammatories ( NSAIDs ), but chronic use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen can erode the stomach lining and cause potentially dangerous bleeding. The new cox-2 inhibitors celecoxib ( Celebrex ) and rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) appear to avoid this problem entirely while maintaining equal efficacy against osteoarthritis pain and inflammation, according to two studies published last week in the Journal of the  American Medical Association . It's no accident that Celebrex has vaulted into first place among prescription painkillers. But Celebrex and Vioxx cost from  $ 90  to  $ 120  a month, which can be prohibitive for many people, especially if they have little or no prescription drug coverage. Eventually,  Moskowitz  thinks, " more cox-2 inhibitors will come out and the price will come down."

Whatever improvements emerge in medical therapy _ conventional or alternative _ many osteoarthritis patients will eventually run out of stop-gap options. For them, the ultimate treatment is an artificial knee or hip. " Total knee and hip replacement have totally revolutionized arthritis treatment, in terms of keeping people walking and off crutches,"  Moskowitz  says. " When patients say, ` Doc, this is really interfering with my lifestyle and the medicines aren't helping anymore,' it's appropriate to take the risk."  Thomas Ercoline , 64, is glad he did. After conventional medicine and acupuncture no longer relieved the excruciating pain caused by his knee arthritis, the  Peterborough ,  N.H.  man had joint replacement surgery in  July . " Initially the pain was worse than the arthritis. The first two weeks after the operation you wonder why you had it done,"  Ercoline  said.
 " But when I found I could walk up and down stairs again, and walk with a normal gait, it sure was worth it."  (  Richard A. Knox  is a member of the  Globe  staff. His e-mail address is rknox ( at ) globe.com )
