Independent booksellers are a famously fractious group, as the name suggests. In their two-decades war against chain stores and, more recently, online booksellers, they have shared little beyond common enemies _  Barnes & Noble ,  Borders ,  Amazon , the price clubs _ and a will to survive. Isolated from one another in neighborhoods across  America , they have fought a guerrilla war with discouraging results. Nearly half the independent booksellers have disappeared since  1994 , according to the  American Booksellers Association . Now the Internet, the site of so much recent loss for the independents, will take on greater importance as a battleground in the next two months. Set to debut are two large-scale Web sites that seek to promote the independents. But many wonder whether the sites are jumping in too late and can compete with the customer service of the online giants  Amazon.com  and  Barnesandnoble.com .
On  June 6 , the booksellers association will begin to unveil  Booksense.com , a site turning the independents into " local store dot-com, closed but open 24 hours a day," says  Michael Hoynes , the program's marketing officer. Next to come, in early  July , is  Contentville , a site produced by  Steven T. Brill , which will, according to its senior vice president and e-publisher,  Annik LaFarge , make some 40 of the most respected booksellers in the country the " heart and soul" of its book retailing area. The sites hope to showcase the independents as stores run by booksellers with personalities as unique and marketable as their books. But they are built on very different business models. Booksense.com is a " hub site" for hundreds of individual Web sites created and maintained by local stores. Each will have its own Web address and set its own prices. What is unusual about  Contentville 's relationship with the independent booksellers it has recruited _  Glenn Goldman  of Book Soup in  Los Angeles ,  Neal Sofman  of A Clean Well Lighted Place in  San Francisco  and a former  ABA  president,  Ed Morrow  of  Northshire Bookstore  in  Manchester Center ,  Vt. , among others _ is that the independents will not actually be selling books on  Contentville .
Instead, they will provide editorial content for a fee and will get an equity stake in the company should  Contentville  go public.  Sara Farley , an e-commerce analyst at  PaineWebber , believes the biggest issue for the new sites lies in customer service, exactly the territory the independents in  Booksense.com , in particular, will have the least control over. " The trick," she says, " is providing a great customer experience. Amazon has spent five years developing a complicated and hopefully very robust distribution and fulfillment network. They didn't snap their fingers." To meet the challenge, the sites have established alliances with  Baker & Taylor  and  Ingram , wholesalers that have traditionally dealt in bulk orders to booksellers and now face the challenge of shipping smaller orders directly to consumers' homes. Ingram, for example, has worked over the  last two years  to improve its ability to ship smaller orders to more customers, and over the  last year  has developed this operation in earnest delivering books for  Barnesandnoble.com  and Buy.com, the two largest of 20 such clients it works with.
Ingram has a cash investment in  Contentville , which " gives us reassurance they'll do it right," said  Brill . Booksense.com has reached similar distribution agreements with  Baker & Taylor  and other wholesalers. The wholesalers' ability to deliver on their promises is crucial, says  Lorraine Shanley , a publishing consultant at  Market Partners . " The online component of bookselling is difficult for people without the resources and organizational savvy of  Amazon ," she said."  ABA  is a trade organization." The obstacle, she says, is the same as it was for  Barnes & Noble  when it went online. " They are trying to jerry-rig entrenched systems, as opposed to building a Web-based transactional business, which is what  Amazon  did," she said.
 Len Vlahos , director of  Booksense.com , says customer service will be the strength of the program. " The local store itself will be point of customer contact," he said. " There's an actual person in the store, which has many more years of customer service experience than  Amazon ." But the question still remains whether the Internet plays to the independents' strengths as retailers. Online booksellers can't replicate the experience of browsing and buying books in a store, says  Jeffrey Fieler , consumer Internet analyst at  Bear Stearns . Though he acknowledges that " the independents have to do something or they will be marginalized" even further, he is skeptical that a niche retailer can develop a significant market share in a category already well-served on the Web. Last year, according to  Fieler , people visited an average of 15 sites a month.
This year, he says, the number has shrunk to 10. " People are finding the places that meet their needs," he says. " The larger sites in each area are adding functionality so that people don't need to go to other sites." Booksense.com, which has been delayed since the fall by technical problems, grows out of Booksense, a " national marketing umbrella" launched by the booksellers association for its beleaguered members in  February 1999 . In the  last 16 months , Booksense has attracted 1,154 stores across the country to its offline program. It offers, among other features, a bestseller list drawn from members' stores, gift certificates redeemable at any affiliated store ( allowing direct competition with the ubiquity of the chains ) and national advertising promoting independents' reading recommendations.Booksense.com charges participants a set-up fee, a monthly maintenance fee and takes  4.5 percent  in commissions on orders shipped from wholesale partners. The association has earmarked more than  $ 2 million  for promotion.

Joseph MacNamara said San Jose City Council had spent  $ 40.6 million  in advertising, promotion and public relations in the  last quarter  alone, though Santa Clara County sells more than books. Local marketing by the independents themselves, together with significant in-store promotion of the individual Web sites, is seen as key to San Jose's viability. Fieler also sees risks in this limited approach. " Partnerships with other sites that command large shares" of Internet traffic, such as MacNamara and Noble's relationship with  AOL , or Los Angeles's relationship with  Yahoo , will be crucial for the venture, he said. Research from the  American Booksellers Association  shows, MacNamara says, that the typical customer of an independent bookstore buys an average of 20 books a year, but only eight of those at an independent store. Booksense's goal is to build the independents' share to 10 or 11. ( MORE )  nn  Contentville  has significantly more marketing clout and will sell more than books : content from newspapers and magazines, as well as e-books, dissertations and other material.

It will spend  $ 75 million  in advertising over the  next two years , according to  Brill , who estimates that books will account for 25 to  30 percent  of the site's total revenue. Both  NBC  and  CBS  have invested in  Contentville , and the site will be advertised on the networks beginning in  July  in some markets. The  Contentville  independents will create a variety of editorial features, including recommended " libraries" of essential books in various categories, " If You Ask Me" endorsements of books they love and new books they are enthusiastic about. There will also be store bestseller lists and " Buzz on the Floor" notes on local happenings that have helped sales of certain titles. But  Shanley  questions whether the local flavor will help on the Web, where " virtual communities are more important than land-based ones." The new sites are complementary _  Contentville  will have pages that point back to Web sites that may be part of Booksense. This may be an advantage for the booksellers involved in the programs.
  Roxanne Coady  of  R.J. Julia Books  in  Madison ,  Conn. , who is participating in both sites, said : " Booksense as a branding campaign,  Booksense.com  and  Contentville  can all act to remind consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice. That alone is a big deal."
