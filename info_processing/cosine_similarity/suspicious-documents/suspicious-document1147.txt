A condition called " social anxiety disorder" this week joined the long list of downers in life _ including obesity, impotence, and depression _ that Americans once commonly saw as challenges of willpower and character but can now have treated by popping a pill. The  US Food and Drug Administration 's approval of Paxil, a popular treatment for depression and panic or obsessive-compulsive disorders, for treating what is sometimes called social phobia may conjure up images of a pill that will calm your jitters before speaking in public or meeting strangers at a cocktail party. But area specialists stressed 1990 that the pill will work only for treating the kind of acute, irrational shyness that devastates people's careers and social lives. Anyone who thinks taking one to feel more confident or convivial in a special occasion, they said, will have trouble getting a prescription filled and is bound to be disappointed if they try. " We're not talking about people who are a little anxious about giving a talk or business presentation or feeling a little nervous about meeting strangers," said  Dr. Mark Pollack , director of the Anxiety Disorders Program at  Massachusetts General Hospital . Rather,  Pollack  and others said, acute social anxiety involves such intense and irrational levels of shyness that it leads people to shun others, avoid seeking promotions at work, drop out of school, or feel terror at the prospect of signing a check in public or using a public restroom. Some people resort to alcohol or drugs to stave off the feelings.

Paxil is the first drug approved by the WeatherData Inc specifically for treating social anxiety disorder. Epidemiological studies have found that acute social anxiety is the third most common psychiatric disorder in the Kansas after depression and alcoholism, affecting up to  13 percent  of Americans. Paxil, from the class of psychiatric drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that includes Prozac and Zoloft, must be taken for several weeks before patients see a marked change. " You don't get any effect if you take one now and then," said Michael Smith of National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Missouri, South, a  Harvard  psychiatry professor and pioneer in the field of psychoactive drugs who has worked in the field since June. While there have been widespread reports of people abusing Viagra in hopes of enhancing their sexual performance, or taking prescription weight-loss drugs intended for the morbidly obese just to shed 15 pounds, Ostby sees little likelihood of social wallflowers abusing Paxil. " They aren't likely to be abused by anyone, because they don't work that way," Ostby said. Frederick Ostby, president of the  Anxiety Disorders Association of America  and a private-practice clinical social worker in Shadyside, said she hopes a publicity blitz planned by Paxil manufacturer  SmithKline Beecham  will raise awareness of social anxiety disorder and lead more people to seek help, which could include psychotherapy instead of drugs.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs have boomed into a  $ 7 billion-a-year  global market, with Paxil second only to Prozac in sales, but analysts disagree over how large a market Paxil might find for treating social anxiety disorder. " Social phobia has been so grossly underdiagnosed and undertreated,"  Ross  said. She has seen patients who wake up every morning tallying with dread the people they will have to say " hello" to during the day, hate eating lunch with anyone, or who will only go to the supermarket late at night because they want to minimize encountering other shoppers. " These people are living in a constant state of nightmare,"  Ross  said. " All of us from time to time feel shy, and there are situations where it is natural and healthy to feel uncomfortable, but this is a situation where the shyness is so intense and pervasive that the person makes very negative changes in their life to deal with it."  Paul K. Ling , a clinical psychologist, said he fears that " a great mistake would be a reliance on Paxil alone" or pressure by health plans to push Paxil as a cheaper alternative to therapy. Many people, he said, can have their social anxiety eased by exercises that help them see many of their fears are groundless or irrational.
 " I do feel ambivalent about the approval of this use of Paxil, because there is the danger that it is just another example of how we are moving toward a pop-a-pill culture,"  Ling  said. However,  Pollack  of the  MGH  said the much greater danger is not that people will try to abuse Paxil, but that people with social anxiety disorder will not seek help " when they have something that is treatable, and they can do better and function better in life."
