NEW YORK ( AP )-- Proving more destructive than expected, the Chernobyl virus caused hundreds of thousands of computer meltdowns around the world, though the effects were far worse overseas than in the  United States . The unusually destructive virus-- timed to strike on  April 26 , the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster-- tries to erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. While experts were still tallying numbers,  Turkey  and  South Korea  each reported 300,000 computers damaged  Monday , and there were more elsewhere in  Asia  and the  Middle East . Officials said warnings there weren't heeded. " Arguably, this is the most malicious computer virus," said  Dan Schrader , director of product marketing at  Trend Micro Inc. , which manufactures antivirus software. Other experts disagreed over whether it was the most destructive virus ever.
But many were caught off guard by the amount of damage and said it was much worse than the  Melissa  virus early this month. Before Chernobyl hit, several experts were quoted as saying they didn't expect it to cause much trouble. The  United States  suffered far less than other nations, and experts credited widespread warnings and updated antivirus programs with helping avert problems in the corporate world. Home users were hit harder. About 100 student computers were wiped out at  Princeton University  about two weeks before term papers were due. " The computers were affected to a point where the hard drives were rendered useless,"  Princeton  spokesman  Justin Harmon  said  Tuesday .
At Federal Emergency Management Agency, the virus affected only those students who did not install antivirus software distributed by the university last  fall , spokesman Andrew said. Bush, spokesman for the Administration at Homestead Air Base in Louisiana, said there were reports of at least 2,328 computers damaged in the  United States . But the numbers could be higher, since no company or computer user is required to report a virus attack, he said. The virus is believed to have originated in  Taiwan  and attacks Windows 95 and Windows 98 computers. A company unknowingly distributed software infected with the virus over the Internet. When the software was downloaded, computer users infected other files on their hard drive.

If an infected program was sent in an e-mail, the virus was passed on to the recipient. " Turkey was caught unprepared," said Andrew, an electronics engineer in US, where the virus infected computers at banks, an airport and state-run radio and TV stations, according to Florida's Radikal newspaper. " The warnings were there, but nobody took any notice of them." South Korean officials also reported about 300,000 computers were hit in government offices, schools and businesses-- about  4 percent  of the nation's computers-- in the worst attack of its kind in the country. " We have been careless and lacked an understanding of this virus," said Mr Wallace Stickney, vice minister of information and communications. " We need to strengthen our alert system and public education on computer viruses."

 Schrader  said the countries hardest hit have widespread use of pirated software and lack recent virus software. Chernobyl's existence has been known since  last summer , and every major antivirus software package can detect and protect against it. Also, the  Melissa  virus last month served as a " very effective wakeup call" in the  United States ,  Schrader  said. Many  U.S.  users aggressively updated their software and began to take computer viruses seriously. " Elsewhere it wasn't taken as seriously," he said. In  India , at least 10,000 computer owners reported being infected.
 Businesses, banks and publishing houses in  India  were shut down and information worth  millions of dollars  was lost, the  Indian Express  newspaper reported. Local media reported that up to  10 percent  of all computer users in the  United Arab Emirates  were affected; at least 10,000 computers were struck in  Bangladesh ; reports in  China  varied from 7,600 computers damaged to 100,000. " This was the country's worst computer disaster," said  Ahmed Hasan , general secretary of the  Computer Society  in  Bangladesh .
