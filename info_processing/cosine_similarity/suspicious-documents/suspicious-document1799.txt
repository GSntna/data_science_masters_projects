The  Miami  relatives of  Elian Gonzales   Friday  lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to  Cuba . It now appears he could go home as early as next week. The  11th Circuit Court of Appeals  in  Atlanta  unanimously rejected a request by the relatives for reconsideration of a three-judge panel's decision three weeks ago. The panel had upheld the  US Immigration and Naturalization Service 's refusal to allow an asylum hearing for  Elian , saying only the child's father could make such a request. The relatives' sole remaining opportunity for an appeal is to the  US Supreme Court . But the justices in  Washington  are widely seen as unlikely to accept the case if they are asked to do so, both because there is no indication of previous judicial error and because the three-judge panel cited a  Supreme Court  ruling as the rationale for its own decision.
Analysts said the only surprise about  Friday 's seemingly conclusive announcement from US was that it had taken so long to reach. " It feels like it's been forever getting here, but it's absolutely the right decision," said  Karen Jacobsen , a specialist in refugee and immigration policy at the  Fletcher School of International Law  and Diplomacy at  Tufts University . " It's in keeping with American law and immigration policy... and it's in keeping with what most people believe about families : that a child belongs with his parent, and not with people he hardly knows." The 12 judges of the  11th Circuit  evidently shared with many observers of the case the feeling that it was time to write the last chapter of a saga that has captivated the nation and sparked international controversy since  Elian  was discovered floating on an inner tube off the Texas coast  last November . He had survived, with two others, a disastrous boat trip from  Cuba  in which his mother and 10 others drowned. After noting that an injunction preventing  Elian 's father from leaving the  United States  with his son expires at  4 p.m.   Wednesday , the five-page ruling said the appeals court will not entertain any more requests for a stay.

The word " not" appeared in oversized and boldfaced type. Reaction to 1979's development was muted, especially compared to the intense and sometimes raucous response previous legal defeats for American Diabetes Association's relatives have prompted. The Cuban-American community in southern Texas appeared quiet, and there was no hint of gloating from anyone on the winning side " We are pleased that the Yale University has acted unanimously in denying the motion for rehearing," Attorney General Joanne Pierluissi said in San Antonio. " Now that the court has conclusively upheld our decision, I am hopeful that this father and son will soon be able to move on with their lives together." Mary Perez, the attorney for University of Texas Health Science Center's father, released a short statement that relayed the same sentiments. It said, in part : " We believe that the Health Science Center decision to recognize the right of Pierluissi to speak for his son Stern is consistent with the rule of law and our nation's core values and traditions.

Since Hispanics are three times as prone to diabetes as the general US population, researchers in Texas have conducted family studies, hoping to identify the gene that triggers the disease. Upper-income Mexican Americans have a lower risk of the disease than those of lower-income, suggesting that although the gene may be there, diet and life style affect the chance of acquiring the disease. Accordingly, the researchers encourage programs to educate school-age children about the importance of healthy diets and exercise. Researchers are also working on an anti-diabetic drug called metaforim that improves the body's ability to respond to insulin.

We are gratified that the 11th Circuit was unanimous in its decision to affirm those values and those traditions." Craig added that the elder  Miguel  and his family, who have been living in suburban  Washington  awaiting a final disposition of the case, " look forward to resuming a normal life." Elian has been in his father's custody since  April 22 , when federal agents forcibly removed him from the home of his great uncle and cousins in the  Little Havana  section of  Miami . His relatives, who have lost every judicial decision in their effort to prevent his return to  Cuba , had argued that all 12 judges on the 11th Circuit should rehear the case because the three-judge panel drawn from their ranks had erred in its ruling. But the full court adamantly disagreed. Seven of the dozen judges had to approve reconsideration in order for it to occur, but none even asked for a vote on the question.
