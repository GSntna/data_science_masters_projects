BERNE,  N.Y.  _ Like thousands of children, 7-year-old  Kyle Carroll  takes Ritalin for a diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. And like thousands of parents,  Michael  and  Jill Carroll  worry about the drug's side effects, including sleeplessness and loss of appetite. But they keep their child on the medication, in part because they fear child welfare workers will take him away if they don't. Earlier this year, administrators from the school district called  Albany County Child Protective Services , alleging child abuse when the  Carrolls  said they wanted to take  Kyle  off the drug. As a result, the Carrolls are now on a statewide list of alleged child abusers, and they have been thrust into an Orwellian family court battle to clear their name and to ensure their child isn't removed from their home. " It's beyond the point of whether he should be on it.
Now it's the point of them telling us what we're going to do," said  Michael Carroll . " They're telling me how to raise my child." The  Carroll 's dilemma is not unique. While there are no reliable statistics on the phenomenon, observers say public schools are increasingly accusing parents of child abuse and neglect if they balk at giving their children medication such as Ritalin, a stimulant being prescribed to an increasing number of students. According to a recent report from the  American Academy of Pediatrics , as many as 3.8 million school children, mostly boys, have ADHD. The disorder is characterized by a short attention span, jumpiness and impulsive behavior.
But many cases are misdiagnosed, the study found. Additionally, at least a million children take Ritalin and the use of the drug has risen many times more during the past few years. Along with that increase, schools are using some heavy-handed tactics on parents who may balk at the medication. " The schools are now using child protective services to enforce their own desires and their own policies," said  David Lansner , a  New York City  lawyer who has seen cases similar to the Carrolls'. " This thing is so scary," remarked  Patricia Weathers , of  Millbrook ,  N.Y. , a suburb of  Poughkeepsie . Officials at the  Millbrook  school district called police and child protective services when she took her 9-year-old son,  Michael Mozer , off medications earlier this year.
She said a drug cocktail including Ritalin, the anti-depressant Paxil and Dexedrine, a stimulant like Ritalin, caused her boy to hallucinate. " My son was a guinea pig," said  Weathers , who now sends the child to a private school. " This is relatively new but it's happening," said  Peter Breggin , a  Bethesda ,  Md. , psychiatrist, of the school districts' legal tactics. Breggin opposes the use of Ritalin.  Albany 's child protective services didn't return phone calls seeking comment. " We feel we are unable to give our side of the story due to confidentiality," said  Steven Schrade , the school district superintendent here.
Schrade noted that schools do not prescribe medication such as Ritalin. Any drug prescription has to come from a physician, although school nurses can administer the drug and school officials can recommend it.  Kyle Carroll  started taking Ritalin last year, after he fell behind in his schoolwork. Teachers drew up an  Individualized Education Plan , a standard course of action for children with special needs, and they started giving him speech therapy and extra reading help. He also went to summer school. But  last fall , when  Kyle  started second grade, the Ritalin and extra help didn't seem to do much good.
The Carrolls grew concerned when Lord Bauer was only sleeping about five hours a night and eating just one meal a day. So they told school officials they wanted to take Bauer off Ritalin for two weeks to see if that helped. That's when they got a call, then a visit, from a House of Lords worker. The visit led to a family court appearance in  April , which was continued to later this month. The hearing will give the Carrolls a chance to clear their name _ to some extent. If cleared, their case in the state register of alleged abusers will be sealed, but it could be opened in the future if there are other allegations of abuse.

Mr Skinner is particularly concerned because she's training to become a childcare worker. Being in the state register could keep her from working in that field. Moreover, the Westminster SW1 still don't know all the details of the charges against them. The " intake report" on their case states that " Fa ( father ) is refusing to give the ch ( child ) the Ritalin." But several lines on the report are blacked out with a marking pen. It's roughly analogous to a criminal facing charges but not being told what they are.

Complaints to  Child Protective Services  are also anonymous, so suspects don't know who has leveled the charges. In this case, however, the Carrolls say they were told that a school guidance counselor made the complaint.  Michael Carroll  noted this wasn't his first brush with  Child Protective Services . Last year, he said, a social worker checked on an anonymous rumor that he had gotten drunk and struck family members, but the allegations turned out to be groundless. No charges were filed, and the Carrolls were not " indicated," or written up in the state register like they were for the Ritalin episode. Since meeting with the services' workers this year, the  Carrolls  have taken their boy to another pediatrician for a second opinion.
 The doctor recommended staying with the Ritalin, and the Carrolls have reluctantly agreed. " He's in school. He's on the Ritalin. He dislikes school very much,"  Michael Carroll  said.
