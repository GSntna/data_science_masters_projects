The bird virus that killed seven  New Yorkers   last year  has now spread all over the  Americas , say  U.S.  researchers. They warn that the Gulf coast of the  United States  will probably see the next outbreak of  West Nile  virus. Despite the threat,  U.S.  authorities have so far failed to provide the research funding to keep tabs on the virus in wild birds. The scientists say that scrupulous monitoring of bird populations is needed, otherwise it won't be possible to identify and spray high-risk areas with insecticide to kill the mosquitoes that transmit the virus to people. The infection is endemic to  Africa ,  Asia  and  Europe , where it resides harmlessly in many bird species but kills others, according to  Bob McLean , head of the  National Wildlife Health Center  in  Madison ,  Wis . Humans usually get the disease from mosquito bites when the population of infected city birds is sufficiently large to infect enough mosquitoes. In  1997 , 527 people in  Bucharest  were ill with  West Nile  virus, and 50 died.
There is no specific treatment for the infection. The virus may have reached United States 1987 in a bird imported from  Israel . However,  West Nile  expert  Zdanek Hubalek  of the  Czech Academy of Sciences , suggests it may have originally escaped from the  Sloan-Kettering Institute  in  New York , where in the  1950s , a strain of the virus was given to 95 terminal cancer patients as an experimental treatment. But there is evidence that the  New York  outbreak last  summer  which killed thousands of crows, and caused encephalitis in 61  New Yorkers , seven of whom died, resulted from a different strain. But what is certain,  McLean  says, is that as early as last  summer  the virus had already spread to an alarming extent in the  New York  area. " It had already infected more than half the local geese and sparrows. That's scary,"  McClean  says.

And the discovery of the virus in birds in United States, London and  Delaware  1993 has dashed hopes that it would not survive the winter. Nigel Hawkes and his colleagues at the CSO's zoo in Front Royal,  Va. , have calculated that the virus would spread far and wide from  New York  if there were susceptible migratory birds congregating on mosquito-infested wetlands nearby. In this month's issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, they and Hubalek report that there are 77 migratory species there, including ducks, starlings, terns and gulls, capable of carrying the virus. " The virus is probably in every corner of  North America  by now" as well as parts of  South America , says  Rappole . Another outbreak could occur anywhere there are enough infected birds, possibly this 1987. " We think the next outbreak will be along the  Gulf  coast, where northern migrants remain concentrated,"  Rappole  says. " It is essential to capture and test healthy local birds to know where  West Nile  poses a threat,"  McLean  says.

" Then mosquito spraying can be targeted to protect people." McLean's proposals to screen birds in the coming months have not yet been funded. Eastern and Gulf states plan to test dead birds and " sentinel" chickens _ caged birds used as an early warning system. But this is much less sensitive,  McLean  warns. Caged chickens are less likely to encounter infected mosquitoes than free-range birds. But  Stephen Ostroff  of the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  in  Atlanta  told New Scientist : " Extensive screening of wild birds in hopes of finding the virus would not be cost-effective."
