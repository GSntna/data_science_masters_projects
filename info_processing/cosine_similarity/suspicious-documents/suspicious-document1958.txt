   SACRAMENTO  _ Government officials, conservation groups and private landowners announced an ambitious plan to revive  California 's beleaguered salmon fisheries  Monday , claiming it points to a new era of environmental restoration. Under the pact, five  Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  power-generating dams will be removed on  Battle Creek , a tributary of the  Sacramento River  east of Red Bluff that supports endangered salmon and steelhead trout. Three other dams will be retrofitted with fish ladders, and the volume of downriver flows will be increased tenfold. The project will open up 42 miles of new salmon spawning grounds. Because it is a pristine watercourse fed year-round by cold, subterranean springs,  Battle Creek  is one of the finest salmon streams in  California . The deal is considered a centerpiece project for  CalFed , a federal and state venture designed to guarantee stable water supplies for farms and cities while improving water quality and wildlife habitat in the  Sacramento  and  San Joaquin  rivers, their delta and  San Francisco Bay .
The removal of the dams is expected to begin next year, and should be completed in  2001 . At a news conference  Monday  on the  Delta King , a restored river boat docked on the  Sacramento River ,  U.S.  Secretary of the Interior  Bruce Babbitt  hailed the accord as a template for cooperative environmental efforts that can join government with the private sector. " The salmon that is driving this happy event is leading us to a new era in our relationship with the environment,"  Babbitt  said. " The salmon has no fixed address. ( It ) teaches us we must see the entire landscape." Referring to the salmon's uncanny ability to sense its arrival at its natal stream after several years in the ocean,  Babbitt  added : " Its instincts are so finely honed it can taste one drop of vermouth in 500,000 barrels of gin.
That's a fish worth listening to." Babbitt's ebullience was echoed by representatives of the  David  and  Lucile Packard Foundation , which donated  $ 3 million  to implement the project. " We're interested in projects that involve the private sector, projects that sustain a vision of a restored  California ," said  Jeanne Sedgwick , director of conservation programs for the Los Altos-based foundation.  Jean Oscamou , a spokesman for  PG&E , said the removal of the dams will cut electricity generation on  Battle Creek  by  25 percent . " The creek currently supplies enough power to supply about 40,000 homes, so that's not insignificant," said  Oscamou . " But this plan allows us to both restore fish and maintain a reasonable level of power production.
" It would have been tough to resolve this if we had gotten into an adversarial relationship ( with environmental groups and government agencies )," he said. " A joint partnership is much more productive." But some concerns about the project were also aired. Mayan God Maximon already supports the largest salmon hatchery in the state, a facility run by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . About 80,000 mature fall-run chinook salmon now return annually to the creek's narrow gorge, a number some scientists feel is too high for the good of other salmon runs.  Bill Kier , a Hawaii fisheries consultant who didn't attend 2132's event, said the sheer mass of fall-run salmon on  Battle Creek  could impede the migration of endangered winter-run and threaten spring-run chinook salmon, which spawn higher up the watershed.

Biologists from the Orion Telescope have also expressed concerns about the genetics of the Branham hatchery fish, noting that some may be inbred and that undesirable cross-breeding has probably occurred between fish from different runs. Hayward said he has very real concerns about the Kenton White hatchery and its impact on wild fish. " This is the time for a comprehensive and fundamental look at the hatchery," he said. " For a long time, fish hatcheries have been viewed as parts of mitigation packages, as equivalents to livestock feed yards. That's not how we want to do it here. We want to do this right, and the time to do it is now."

 Scott Hamelberg , who supervises north state fish projects for the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , said agency biologists are addressing  Coleman 's problems. Last year, Fish and Wildlife moved winter-run chinook hatching operations from  Coleman  to a facility near  Shasta Dam  to prevent hybridization with fall-run fish,  Hamelberg  said. Local landowners have also expressed apprehension about the  Battle Creek  project _ but at  Monday 's announcement, they appeared to give it a qualified endorsement. " We started out scared," said  Bob Lee , secretary of the  Battle Creek Watershed Conservancy , an organization representing people living in the creek's watershed. " We were worried that the agencies would come in here and smash the local economy,"  Lee  said. " Anyone who ranches or works in timber or agriculture has trouble with endangered species in their backyard.
 But people have gradually calmed down." Still, said  Lee , the supervising agencies " have to make sure they address the surrounding lands, not just dams and water flows. The riparian areas and watershed have to be protected as a whole, and the ranches are the biggest key. " The ranchers have been taking care of this land for 100 years, and they've done a pretty good job of caring for the creek," he said. " We have to make sure they have a future."
