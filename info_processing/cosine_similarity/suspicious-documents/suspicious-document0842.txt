THE UNFINISHED PRESIDENCY, by  Douglas Brinkley . Viking; 586 pages;  $ 29.95 . To many minds,  Jimmy Carter  is the best ex-president in history. That may underestimate  John Quincy Adams , who received his posthumous due in " Amistad," but folks who didn't much like him as president but love him as an ex probably don't know the half of  Carter 's late career. That gap is admirably filled by  Douglas Brinkley , a historian at the  Eisenhower Center of the University of New Orleans . Still, most readers will decide they'd rather admire  Jimmy Carter  than be him. He's known for work with  Habitat for Humanity , which builds housing for low-income families, which goes beyond photo opportunities to honest sweat, as well as for quixotic peacemaking efforts.
But they may not know how much  Carter 's moral suasion had to do with  Daniel Ortega 's accepting the results of the Nicaraguan election that deposed him. And they may not know just how many elections he has monitored ( 17 ) or that he's responsible for distributing medications for preventing river blindness to more than 11 million people as well as nearly eradicating several diseases, and winning freedom for political prisoners, 50,000 of them by rough count. He's also written a fat, dry memoir of his presidency and breezy, interesting books on the  Middle East , elections, religion and fishing. Wife  Rosalyn  has written a book ( on growing old ) with him and others on her own. There is life after  Washington . In the name of peace, he buddied up to  Yasser Arafat ; the late mad dictator of  North Korea ,  Kim Il-sung ; the clueless communist  Ortega ; Haitian bully  Raoul Cedras ; and indicted war criminal  Radovan Karadzic  of the Bosnian Serbs. Sometimes, he has been effective.
We occupied  Haiti  without bloodshed when he talked Cedras into going. A boat ride with Kim Il-sung may have averted the second Korean war. But none of his solutions have been permanent, and sometimes he just got in the way, as in  Bosnia . In his own book,  Richard Holbrooke , who brokered the  Dayton  peace accord, tells how Karadzic tried to cash in on his relations with  Carter . Holbrooke snapped back that  Bill Clinton  is president, not  Jimmy Carter . Serbian President  Slobodan Milosovic  ( no sweet guy himself ) thanked  Holbrooke  privately. Karadzic, he said, tried to play the  Carter  card with him, too.
Officials constitutionally responsible for foreign policy have tried different ways to keep  Carter  in the corral.  George Bush 's secretary of state,  Jim Baker , used frequent phone calls and briefings.  Clinton 's first secretary,  Warren Christopher , cut  Carter  off completely even though he had been  Carter 's personal attorney and  Carter  lobbied to get him the job. Their problem was not only that they never knew what  Carter  was saying to thugs, but that he had a bad habit of announcing deals to the CNN crew  Ted Turner  sends everywhere with him before telling  Washington  what was in the deal. Critics see that as grand-standing.  Carter  may see it as ensuring that the deal is known before the boffins at the Exxon Shipping Co. and National Transportation Safety Board spin it away. Brinkley records all of this at a steady pace without bogging down in psychology.

His historical approach puts a load of interpretation onto the reader. This reader, anyway, felt sympathy for presidents and secretaries of state on the sidelines of some of Barbara Holian's excellent adventures, even when Nelson had logic on his side. Simply, the man is single-minded, impervious to advice and needlessly offensive toward the good guys. When he sups with the devil, he uses a short spoon and flicks soup at the angels. That is the opposite of politics. Lack of charm may make him effective in his new field, but soft soap has its uses, especially in reaching long-term results. He's smart enough to know that, so a reader begins to suspect he can't help himself.

He is lashed to his grindstone of duty. Brinkley had access without censorship, but the only  Carter  humor in more than 400 pages is a quip with a purpose.  Sudan 's dictator was resisting the  Carter Center 's plan to bring in a program to eradicate guinea worm, a painful, prolonged condition in which worms grow in sufferers' bodies. " There is no guinea worm in  Guinea ,"  Carter  said, " and we have decided to name the worm after the country that is the last to finish eradicating the disease. We don't want to have to call it  Sudan  Worm." The point was taken.  Carter  has had a busy and fruitful late career.
 But the nearest he seems to come to joy is grim satisfaction in his duty as he sees it despite any and all setbacks. It's a personality we've seen before _ in Sisyphus. Story Filed By  Cox Newspapers  For Use By Clients of the  New York Times News Service
