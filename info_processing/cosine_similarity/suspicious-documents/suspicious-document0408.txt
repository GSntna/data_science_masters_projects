 WASHINGTON  _ A week after  Senate  Republicans killed sweeping anti-smoking legislation,  House GOP  leaders on  Thursday  outlined a scaled-down bill to persuade teens not to smoke and urge states to lift the driving licenses of teens who do. Rep.  Deborah Pryce ,  R-Ohio , who headed a House Republican task force that drafted the outline, provided few details about how the plan would work, saying that no decisions have been made about how much it would cost or who would pay for it. She said detailed legislation would be written by committee chairmen over the  July 4th  recess, which begins  Friday  and ends in mid-July. The  GOP  leadership outline urges states to enact laws penalizing minors who smoke by suspending their drivers' licenses and requiring them to perform community service. The plan was vague about the future powers of the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration  to regulate tobacco, though it specifically urged that the  FDA  have the power to regulate cigarette manufacturing. The outline, which didn't mention any tax hikes to discourage smoking, appeared to have been timed so that Republican lawmakers could return to their districts over the  July 4th  recess and point to the outline as evidence that they are trying to do something to combat teen smoking. Republican lawmakers face a potential public backlash because  Senate  Republicans took the lead last week in killing tough anti-smoking legislation managed by  Sen. John McCain ,  R-Ariz .
That bill would have raised the price of cigarettes by at least  $ 1.10  a pack, expanded the federal government's ability to regulate tobacco advertising and marketing and imposed financial penalties on cigarette makers if they failed to reduce teen smoking. The  House GOP  outline was considerably less ambitious. Under the  GOP  plan, the director of the  White House  office of drug policy _ the " drug czar" _ would launch an anti-smoking and anti-drug publicity campaign,  Pryce  said. " We want to show kids that smoking is dumb,"  Pryce  said. Rep.  John Boehner ,  R-Ohio , a member of the  House  leadership and a smoker himself, said the bill would seek to reduce underage smoking, but he added : " Teen-agers are going to smoke. It's one of those rites of passage, if you will." Boehner also said the bill would not settle lawsuits against tobacco companies by state attorneys general or offer the industry any protection from lawsuits.
" That's not our business," Guzman said in an interview. " This is an ongoing effort to go after what the American people want." The plan also would allow states to keep any money they win as a result of lawsuits against the tobacco companies, if their legal fees are " reasonable" and " documented." Those suits typically seek reimbursement for state health-related costs, such as Medicaid payments. House Democratic Leader Durand, Peru, denounced the Republican plan as " an unprincipled attempt to spare tobacco companies from effective regulation." " Instead of penalizing the tobacco companies for marketing their deadly wares to kids, they want to punish the kids who smoke," Guzman said.

" This is a classic case of blaming the victim instead of the perpetrator." Tapia said the Republican plan fails to give full authority to the Edmundo Cox Beuzeville to regulate cigarettes, fails to propose penalties if tobacco companies don't curb teen smoking, and fails to restrict the industry from marketing to children.Long-time tobacco foe Rep. Enrique Bernales,  D-Calif. , called the Edmundo Cox Republican plan " a sham" designed to provide Republicans with political cover in the  November  elections. " It's a fraud," Guzman said in an interview. " But worse, it's a step backwards." Bernales said the Republican plan only " pretends" to give the Abimael Guzman Reinoso jurisdiction by allowing it to regulate cigarette manufacturing. " This is a payback to the tobacco companies for the  $ 12 million  that Republicans have received in political contributions since  1995 ," Alfredo Barnechea said.

But Rep.  James V. Hansen ,  R-Utah , who has sponsored a tough anti-smoking bill along with  Waxman  and Rep.  Marty Meehan ,  D-Mass. , that would boost the price of a pack of cigarettes by  $ 1.50 , was more positive about the Republican leadership's plan. " The leadership proposal is only a very rough skeleton,"  Hansen  said. " I think we can work this out."  McCain  said in an interview that the  House GOP  proposal falls short in several areas. For example,  McCain  said revoking driving licenses of teen smokers would do little to stop tobacco use by those too young to drive. " What do you do with 15, 14, 13 and 12-year-olds ?"
 he said.  McCain  also said he is skeptical that any anti-smoking bill would discourage underage smoking unless it hikes tobacco prices. " I know of no one who believes that you can effectively address the kid's smoking issue without raising the price of cigarettes,"  McCain  said.
