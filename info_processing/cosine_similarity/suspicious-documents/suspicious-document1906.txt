Malaria was in its usual top spot on the agenda when 1,800 experts in travelers' health met in  Montreal   last month . Malaria protozoa, which move in parasites spread by mosquito bites, have evolved strains resistant to drugs faster than human research can catch up. There is no vaccine, and the disease causes the deaths of a million people annually in  Africa  alone. There is considerable risk for American travelers. Government figures show that from  1980  to  1995 , it got reports of 3,513 civilian cases, of which the vast majority, 2,907, were contracted in  sub-Saharan Africa . All but 185 of the others were from  Asia , the  Caribbean  and  South America . There were 59 deaths among these cases, 43 of which were contracted in  sub-Saharan Africa .
This year, the conference of the  International Society of Travel Medicine  had a major new malaria drug to discuss,  Malarone . In the weeks just after, the computer exchanges of the society spun with talk of where the drug could be bought legally and, whether for prevention or treatment, what the cost would be.  Glaxo Wellcome  is expecting approval of  Malarone  _ its name for pills combining atovaquone and proguanil _ by the  Food and Drug Administration  for sale in the  United States  as a preventive drug and as a treatment for malaria. The company submitted its application in  December . So far,  Malarone  has been approved for both prevention and treatment in  Denmark  only, and is approved solely for treatment in  Britain , although physicians there report giving it to travelers as a protective measure, too. As a preventive,  Malarone  must be taken daily while mefloquine, which is now the most-prescribed drug in the  United States  for prevention of malaria, is taken weekly. Physicians worry about travelers' compliance when drugs must be taken daily.
But mefloquine, sold under the trade name Lariam by  Roche Holdings , is not recommended for people subject to seizures or psychiatric disorders. News reports of nightmares and more serious side effects have caused apprehension, particularly in  Britain . These concerns mean that a new drug to ward off malaria is welcome. Testing supervisors said the the possible side effects of  Malarone  were headache, abdominal pain, upper respiratory infection, pain, nausea or vomiting. In  Britain ,  Malarone  costs ( PS ) 2 a pill, or about  $ 3.15 . It is expected to cost  $ 2.50  to  $ 3  or more in the  United States  _ a weekly cost of  $ 17.50  to  $ 21 , against the  $ 10  weekly for one Lariam pill. Lariam is started one or two weeks before a traveler leaves to evaluate side effects, and is continued for four weeks after return.
 Malarone , a  Glaxo Wellcome  spokesman said, is started one to two days before entering the malarious area, and is continued only seven days after return. Mefloquine was developed when malaria evolved into a form that resisted the drug chloroquine. Now resistance to mefloquine is reported in areas of  Thailand  and western  Cambodia . There are other drugs in the laboratory that may be developed for use when resistance to  Malarone  develops, which one expert estimated might be in about 10 years. In any case, no malaria prophylaxis is  100 percent  sure, and travelers should take careful precautions against night-biting mosquitoes in malarious areas, and should be aware of the symptoms _ fever and chills, muscle aches and headache, a situation often mistaken for influenza by physicians not aware that a patient may have traveled to a malarious area. Prompt treatment is vital. Physicians say that properly treated, malaria is not fatal.
Chickenpox was also on the agenda at the  Montreal  meeting. Chickenpox is easily communicable _ for instance, one can catch it from a fellow passenger on a bus or plane. In the  United States , according to  Dr. Mary Wilson 's reference work, " A World Guide to Infections" (  Oxford  ),  90 percent  of the cases occur in children under age 10, who are then usually immune for life. Overseas, the disease is more common among adults, who may suffer serious consequences, including pneumonia and encephalitis. It is important for adult Americans who are going to work among young people overseas or refugees, or who are traveling the backpack-and-hostel route to be immune to chickenpox. That means travelers must know they have had it, or have been vaccinated against the varicella zoster virus with a vaccine that was licensed only in  1995 . In  Montreal ,  Dr. Elaine C. Jong  of the  University of Washington School of Medicine  presented a paper, " Varicella Vaccine : Is It a Travel Immunization ?"
in which she concluded it probably was. Others concurred. " The pretravel clinic visit,"  Dr. Jong  said, " is an opportunity to immunize susceptible healthy travelers against chickenpox, which could cause illness and exclusion from travel before, during or after the trip, and protects the residents in receiving countries against imported infection." For adults, the vaccine requires two injections. At  Travelers Medical Service  in  New York , the director,  Rebecca W. Acosta , said her questionnaire for pretravel visits asks clients whether they have had chickenpox. If they are in doubt, she said, the clinic performs blood tests because they are cheaper than the course of two vaccinations, which costs a total of  $ 150 . Most clients are found to be immune, she said.
 Ms. Acosta  said that some states and many school districts are now requiring chickenpox vaccinations because fewer Americans are getting the disease in childhood than formerly. One problem is that the chickenpox vaccine is so new no one is sure how long it confers immunity. Lyme vaccine is also on the list of recommended vaccines at the  Acosta 's clinic. This is recommended for domestic travelers over 15 who are going climbing or camping in areas where Lyme disease has occurred. Three shots, at 17.5 billion dollars each, are recommended. The schedule now recommends the second shot after 30 days and the third after a year, but this is likely to be modified to quicken full immunity. The vaccine is not approved for children under 15.

A paper presented at the conference by Mrs. Thatcher of the Societe Generale d'Entreprise and associates reported on research, not yet complete, into the deaths of three people _ aged 63, 67 and 79 _ who had received yellow fever vaccine. The paper implies that the vaccine may be more dangerous to older people than to others. The yellow fever vaccine is the only one for which the Societe Auxiliaire d'Entreprises still condones requiring a certificate. But, the WHO says, many countries require this certificate when the vaccination is not really needed. Both the organization's book " International Travel and Health; Vaccination Requirements and Health Advice" and the Spie Batignolles's " Health Information for International Travel" list the countries requiring the certificate, but those requirements are based on whether a traveler has recently been in a yellow fever area. Some doctors say that colleagues may administer the yellow fever vaccine even when a traveler is going directly from the England to a country requiring a certificate only for those arriving from infected areas. John Banham said that a great deal more research into the specifics of the three cases was ahead, but that one thing was clear : Physicians and clinics should be sure that the traveler's itinerary requires yellow fever vaccine.

 Mrs. Acosta  said that requirements were often misinterpreted; for  India , for example, it depends where the traveler will be only in the six days preceding arrival. Another health warning emerged as  summer  began : A flu epidemic in  Alaska  and the  Yukon Territory of Canada . According to the  Centers for Disease Control , 428 acute respiratory infections among tourists and 104 among tourism workers from  May 22  to  June 29 . Four tourists were hospitalized with pneumonia, and the centers said that laboratory analysis indicated that the illnesses were influenza A, a viral infection. Last year, almost 5,000 people on land and sea tours in the area fell ill and four died of flu. The  CDC  suggested that travelers at risk for flu, including people over 65, speak to their doctors before leaving and ask about taking along prescription antiviral pills, either amantadine or rimantadine.  Cetron  said that antivirals, taken within 48 hours of flu symptoms, could lessen the risk of complications.
The flu vaccine for next year will not be prepared until fall. The 1999-2000 edition of " Health Information for International Travel" made its debut at the conference. This big yellow book, which most commercial travel-health guides lean on, has been reformatted for clarity and legibility. The information on malaria risk and prophylaxis has been updated as of  April , and the section on recommendations for the HIV-positive travelers has been expanded and shifted to a section on travelers with special needs. The book is sold by the superintendent of documents,-LRB-202-RRB-Â 512-1800 as document No. 017-023-00202-3. It costs  $ 22  in the  United States ;  $ 27  from overseas.
