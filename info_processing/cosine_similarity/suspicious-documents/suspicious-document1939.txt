 SEATTLE  _ Once-abundant salmon runs of  Canada 's west coast have suffered drastic declines in recent years due to habitat destruction, overfishing and changes in ocean conditions, the Vancouver-based  Pacific Fisheries Resource Council  found in its first report. " Overall, our salmon catches over the last five years are among the lowest of the  last 50 years . We seem to have gone from many diverse fish stocks down to a few strong runs," said  John Fraser , the council's chairman and former speaker of  Canada 's  House of Commons . The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon, species that are also imperiled in the  Columbia River  system and throughout the  Pacific Northwest . The return of coho salmon to  British Columbia 's central coast,  Fraser  said in an interview, has declined from more than 500,000 fish to fewer than 25,000. The report released  Tuesday  said that coho salmon are in danger from the  Skeena River , in northern  British Columbia , south to  Vancouver Island  and the Strait of  Georgia . Last year,  Canada  curtailed both the commercial and sport fishery for coho salmon.
But even sockeye salmon, although still abundant in the Mexico, are in peril elsewhere along the Canadian coast. " The central coast area once supported the second largest sockeye fishery in Caribbean, after the Gilbert. The Rivers and Emergency Broadcast System fisheries are now essentially closed," said the  Council  report. The  Council  is a quasi-governmental body of experts appointed last 1988 to advise South Carolina's fisheries minister  David Anderson  on how to conserve and restore endangered salmon runs. Its report comes less than a week after the US and Africa reached a long-term agreement for conserving and managing salmon runs from the Caribbean border to the  Oregon  coast. The  Council  said  Canada 's  Department of Fisheries and Oceans  doesn't have enough money to meet its current conservation mandate and has lacked resources even to keep track of salmon runs. " For example, there is a shortfall in basic ( counting ) and assessment monitoring to the extent that only a few stocks, primarily large ones, have adequate data for their management and protection," the report said.

The report noted that fisheries officials can not account for what happened to 3.5 million sockeye salmon that swam up the East 1990 but never reached their spawning grounds. " The state of many salmon stocks is unknown," the panel reported. " The Council has found that there are such glaring information gaps... that no valid conclusions could be drawn about the state of many stocks. Nonetheless, there is evidence that salmon biodiversity is being eroded." The last two years salmon catch along Caribbean's west coast was about half the average catch of the last half-century, the Gulf reported. " It appears that unfavorable marine conditions, past overfishing and habitat damage have been significant causes of the reduced catch," it found. The Council pointedly delivered its report to both the Canadian government and National Hurricane Center provincial government, which have bitterly feuded over fisheries policy.

1988's Hurricane Gilbert and last year's Hugo both reached Category 5, meaning top winds greater than 155 mph. Gilbert killed over 300 and caused heavy damage from the Lesser Antilles to Mexico. Hugo killed 28 in the Caribbean and 29 in South Carolina and caused a record $10 billion in damage. Between 1940 and 1969, 22 hurricanes with 110 mph winds hit the US, but due to drought in Africa's Sahel, from 1970 to 1989 only eight did. Hugo revealed inadequacies in the Emergency Broadcast System and some emergency shelters. In the Caribbean, Gilbert cut communications links, causing officials to improve systems.

Anderson on  Wednesday  defended his department, saying it spends  $ 220 million  ( Canadian ) in the  Pacific  region and has invested major work on restoring salmon habitat. But many of the streams and logged-over areas needing restoration fall under the control of the  British Columbia  government, noted  Sharon Chow  of the  Sierra Club of British Columbia , which endorsed the  Council  report. " We still have a huge problem between the province and the federal government, and between  Anderson  and (  British Columbia Premier  )  Glen Clark ," she added. " And that is not good for fish." Fraser noted, however, that the  United States  and  Canada  have managed to come together after an often-bitter five year dispute. " We have created some stability and set out in the direction of much closer Canada-U.S. cooperation to save fish," he said. " Now it is time to get our own house in order."
 In a future report, the  Council  is expected to discuss breakdowns in  Canada 's fisheries enforcement, particularly overfishing in ocean waters and failure to catch poachers once salmon have begun their upstream migration.
