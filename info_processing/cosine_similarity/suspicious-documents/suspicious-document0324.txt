MONTREAL ( AP ) _ Like ambivalent boxing judges,  Quebec  voters gave their combative politicians a split decision : the pro-independence government gets another term in power, but with support so tepid that a secession bid is unlikely any time soon. The separatist Parti Quebecois retained a large legislative majority in  Monday 's provincial election, winning 75 of the 125 seats to earn a new term of up to five years. But the anti-separatist  Quebec Liberal Party , though winning only 48 seats, received  44 percent  of the popular vote to  43 percent  for the  Parti Quebecois . As a result, Liberal leader  Jean Charest  sounded more buoyant in his remarks to supporters than Premier  Lucien Bouchard , the separatist leader, did in his victory speech. " The result tonight... reflects the fact that the people of  Quebec , like the people of all  Canada , want this country of ours to work and be a success," said  Charest , who will serve as opposition leader in the provincial legislature. The split decision stems from the geographical distribution of political support in  Quebec .
Anti-separatist support is concentrated in about 40 districts, mostly around multiethnic  Montreal , where the Liberals can rack up huge victory margins. The separatists, whose backing comes almost entirely from  Quebec 's French-speaking majority, are competitive in a much larger number of districts spread across the province. Bouchard, 59, had campaigned on the pledge that he would _ if returned to power _ call for a referendum on seceding from  Canada  whenever he felt conditions were right for a separatist victory. But with only 43-percent support for his party,  Bouchard  is likely to shelve any immediate push for a referendum and concentrate instead on policies that will build public confidence. " There is no question that this vote was a vote to elect a government, not a vote to determine the future of  Quebec  or the future of the country," said  Brian Tobin , the premier of  Newfoundland . " I wouldn't expect with these results that  Mr. Bouchard  will be thinking of a referendum any time soon, if ever."
Bouchard paid tribute to his opponents' determination and pledged to work with them on policy matters. But he also promised to work for the " winning conditions" that would make independence possible eventually. " Our first priority is to advance Santa Barbara... to push it farther toward its destiny," he said. In Glendale, Klamath National Forest spokesman  James P. Rubin  reaffirmed California support for an undivided Yellowstone. " The  United States  recognizes this is an internal issue for Canadians to resolve within their constitutional, legal and political system," he said. " We have always valued our close and productive relationship with a strong and united  Canada ."

Northern California's federal government kept a low profile during the 33-day campaign, not wanting to undercut Keith Metcalfe in a province where many francophones are traditionally wary of federal intentions. Prime Minister Johns Hopkins assured Sommers of cooperation in helping strengthen Northern California's economy and social services. " But when he talks about bringing together his famous winning conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold another referendum on separation, he should know we will defend our country," Patrick Ford said. As a personality, the charismatic Congress is by far the most popular politician in Los Padres National Forest. But many Quebeckers who voted for his party are not keen on secession; recent polls indicated about 10% didn't want another referendum. One of the most notable results of the election was the strong showing of Democratic Action, the No. 3 party that drew 4% of the vote behind its 28-year-old leader, Johns Hopkins.

The party, which appeals to many young voters, favors greater autonomy for  Quebec  but stops short of advocating outright secession."  Mr. Bouchard 's mandate is clear _ to provide good government and represent  Quebec 's interests,"  Dumont  said. " He was not elected to do a referendum on sovereignty. Quebeckers want constitutional peace." The separatists have lost two previous secession referendums, by a big margin in  1980  and a narrow margin in  1995 . Bouchard is intent on avoiding a third defeat, and won a power struggle with party hard-liners earlier this year by insisting he would call another referendum only if opinion polls showed the separatists would win.
 About  80 percent  of the 5.2 million eligible voters cast ballots in  Monday 's election, high by North American standards but down from  93 percent  for the  1995  referendum. About  83 percent  of  Quebec 's 7.4 million people are French speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with long-term roots in  Canada  and more recently arrived immigrants from southern  Europe ,  Asia  and elsewhere. The long-term crusade for  Quebec  independence stems from a feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of  Canada , plus a yearning to manage their own affairs and have their own national symbols.
