 WASHINGTON ,  D.C.  20003 Tel : 202-547-4512 Fax : 202-546-4194 COPYRIGHT  1998  BY WORLDSOURCES, INC., A JOINT VENTURE OF FDCH, INC.. AND WORLD TIMES,  INC . NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC.. Everyone seems to have his or her own idea about what " Generation X" means. Is it : A ) the name of the so-so punk band  Billy Idol  led over a decade and a half go ? B ) the title of the  1991  " groundbreaking" novel by  Douglas Coupland  ? C ) the title of the exploitative Marvel comic book series ? D ) the buzzword of the decade ( after " information superhighway" ) misused to describe anyone between 20 and 29 years old ?
The answer is, of course, all of the above, but the definition we're most concerned with here is " D". In the'90s, " Generation X" is a fashionable synonym for twentysomethings like " baby boomers" was for thirtysomethings in the'80s. The problem is " Gen X" also comes with plenty of connotational baggage, giving rise to conflicting interpretations and semantic confusion. Some have taken Generation X to mean the " jilted generation" ( from the last summer Prodigy album Music for the Jilted Generation )-- " jilted" in the economic sense. If it were as simple as that, this article would end right here, right now-- but it isn't and this article doesn't. For a crash course on popular Gen X mythos, rent the  Winona Ryder-Ethan Hawke  flick Reality Bites and overdose on all the color-by-numbers Gen X cliches. He's a slacker ! She's an aspiring filmmaker !

He's gay ! Their parents are divorced ! They're dancing to " My Sharona" ! By the time of its release in last summer, the movie's stereotypical Gen X characters were just that-- stereotypes. According to Generation Ecch ! , the definitive spring satirical tome on the Gen X phenom by Bob Barbee and John Varley, it all started with a 1988 Yellowstone cover story that christened the post-boomer generation the " twentysomething" generation, an echo of thirtysomething, that dreary TV show about angst-ridden boomers who dressed incredibly well. " Baby buster" was the catchphrase for a while, as was " 13th generation," before stumbling out of vogue and allowing " Generation X" to seize the buzzword throne. If " Gen X" is the king of buzzwords, then " slacker" is prince, bestowed staying power by Betty Morton's September cult hit film of that name.

To further complicate matters, according to 13th Gen : Abort,  Retry , Ignore, Fail, the definitive  1993  non-satirical tome on the Gen X phenom by  Neil Howe  and  Bill Strauss , Gen X is a mere subset of the " 13ers", the authors' own coinage. The number comes from  Howe  and  Strauss ' thesis that " Counting back to the peers of  Benjamin Franklin , this generation is the 13th to know the American nation, flag, and Constitution." If you're born between  1961  and  1981 , you're a 13er, say the authors. Note, however, that by their definition, 13ers-- and by implication, Gen Xers-- are inherently American. But thanks to the global hegemony of American media and popular culture, certain Gen X affectations engendered by  America 's particular socioscape have also taken root abroad, infecting the youths as distant and discrete as those in  Singapore . Some quirks travel better than others. Sexual paranoia, political correctness, and the trauma of having to live with your parents even though you're over 18 remain exotic notions on our happy, shiny island republic. Other American Gen X idiosyncrasies take on peculiar mutations.
For instance : In  America , you're pessimistic about your financial future because you're stuck at a minimum-wage, dead-end job. In  Singapore , you're pessimistic about your financial future because you haven't made your first million by the time you're 25. Life's a bitch. The nexus that unites so-called Gen Xers around the world ( apart from being born around the same time ) is their common pop cultural experience. A stoner in  Austin ,  Texas , and a yuppie in  Zouk ,  Singapore , may come from different political processes, different educational systems, different social frameworks, different ethnic upbringing, different economic class, different climate zones; yet put the two together and they'll probably bond over an intense discussion whether  Madonna  is a slut. But don't let the label define the generation. Let the generation define itself. -- Excerpted from Internet article by  S.M. Ong  of  Singapore 
In Yellowstone National Park last summer's spectacular season of fire scorched enough timber and meadow to rival Rhode Island in size. Despite infernos that whipped through the treetops like blast furnaces, most of the pristine landscape emerged unscathed. Spring has come and arguments still rage over the impact of the fires on wildlife, the conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes. While the response from tourists is still questionable, the park is bracing for an unprecedented onslaught of scientists looking into fire behavior patterns, its effects on grizzly bears, fisheries, grasslands and the nesting status of bald eagles.
