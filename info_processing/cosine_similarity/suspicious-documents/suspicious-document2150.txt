 TECATE ,  Mexico  _  Enrique Ceballos  is showing two visitors through the organic gardens at  Rancho La Puerta , a spa here on the  Baja  peninsula just across the border from  California . As he talks, he picks his supper. " See the holes in the Swiss chard ?" he asked. " People don't normally buy it because of the holes. I prefer to eat the holes than the chemicals." Then he makes a little joke : " If you are lucky, you get extra protein from the bugs."
In fact, there are very few blemishes on the rows of chard and lettuce, spinach and cabbage, even though chemicals are never sprayed in this three-acre garden. Ceballos' work is guided by one principle : " In nature, all is in balance, and if you kill part of that balance it damages the environment." He also applies that belief in cultivating the olive and fruit trees at the resort, and in tending its beehives. In  summer ,  90 percent  to  95 percent  of the fruits and vegetables served to  Rancho La Puerta 's 150 guests have been grown by  Ceballos  and his staff; in the  winter , the proportion drops to  50 percent . Ceballos, 44, a biologist from  Tecate  with a master's degree in ecology from the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , intended to be a wildlife manager. But 14 years ago he was persuaded to work at the ranch by  Sarah Livia Brightwood , the daughter of its founders. She wanted to restore the organic garden her father had planted 50 years earlier.
" If you talk about healthy living at the ranch, you should be eating healthy food," she said. The garden had lain fallow for 25 years, abandoned when a nematode problem overwhelmed the crops. The worms were still there when work began, but new strategies have been developed for dealing with them. For example, a crop of a species of marigold that is a nematode suppressor was planted. The marigolds did their job so well that other crops could be planted near them. The area of heaviest nematode infestation is now planted with fruit trees that are resistant to them, and with herbs and flowers the pests aren't interested in. Being an organic farmer requires sensitivity, creativity and observation to decide what is planted, and when, where and how; to know such things as which weeds should be left and which pulled, and what companion planting accomplishes.

Elizabeth Taylor always draws intense scrutiny, especially when she is ill. Her current bout with pneumonia has drawn another flurry of interest as she recovers at St. John's Hospital with her four children in attendance. At a press conference Wednesday, her doctors denied that she has either AIDS or cancer. Her life has been one of extremes: great career success and fame but seven failed marriages and bouts of poor health. However, she has exhibited bravery and candor as she battled back problems, operations, bronchitis, pneumonia, and addictions to pain and sleep medications, food and alcohol.

Following are some lessons learned from a stroll in Ceballos' garden. _ Flowers are essential in a vegetable garden because they attract beneficial insects like praying mantises and ladybugs, which eat aphids. _ Basil and tomatoes are planted together because the herb repels worms that love the fruit. _ Plants in the onion family, like chives or garlic, are planted with broccoli and cabbage because the alliums discourage aphids from feasting on the cruciferous vegetables. _ Plants are placed close to one another, to conserve water. Cabbage is planted with lettuce, which matures first; after the lettuce is picked the cabbage fills in the spaces. _ Spinach that grows in the wild is transplanted to beds of cultivated spinach; the wild spinach is more resistant to bugs and gives the cultivated spinach more of a chance.

_ In a form of crop rotation, celery is planted after tomatoes because tomatoes take a lot of nitrogen from the soil and celery needs very little. _ Weeds that are not too aggressive are allowed because their roots help retain moisture in the soil. Ceballos plans to make herbal teas from the new herb garden, and soon there will be eggs from the organic chickens that have just arrived. He also makes about 300 gallons of cold-pressed, unfiltered olive oil from trees in the garden. " This farming is a low-tech activity," he said. " It depends so much on the senses, knowing the cycles of the moon, the soil." Many spa guests spend part of their stay weeding and planting.
 " Some people who live in apartments never have had the opportunity to feel soil,"  Ceballos  said. " They ask me about the trees carrots grow on."
