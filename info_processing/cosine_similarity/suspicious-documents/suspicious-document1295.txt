 LITTLETON ,  Colo.  _ Sgt.  Jim Parr  of the  Jefferson County Sheriff's Office  was not sure he would still have a job on  Wednesday . Around  midnight   Tuesday ,  Parr  drove to Sheriff  John Stone 's home and dragged him over to  Columbine High School  here for an impromptu news conference. Parr's pager had been beeping constantly as news outlets around the world read an  Associated Press  story quoting Stone extensively about the massacre at  Columbine   last week . Much of what the sheriff said about the the existence of evidence and fresh suspects conflicted with what his officers had announced to the world hours earlier. It looked bad. " I'm not going to go on global television and say my boss has made a mistake,"  Parr , a 20-year veteran of police work who has been pulled off patrol to help handle the media swarm since the massacre, said on  Wednesday . " I'll slit my wrists, but I'm not going to do that."
Ever so delicately,  Parr  and  Steve Davis , a sheriff's deputy who serves as the department spokesman, spent most of  Wednesday  clarifying their boss' comments amid growing criticism of the police response to the massacre, in which 2 seniors killed a teacher and 12 classmates  last Tuesday  before turning their guns on themselves. The department is also being questioned about its handling of complaints a year ago that one of the gunmen,  Eric Harris , had threatened a classmate over the Internet, a matter that is now under investigation. Among the corrections of the sheriff's statements : Three students in black trench coats who were detained at  Columbine  last  Tuesday  and then released are not targets of the investigation, but in fact have been cleared. The videotape showing the carnage in the cafeteria is still being analyzed, and may not show the gunmen firing at the students. There is no evidence that  Harris  and his friend  Dylan Klebold , the other gunman, tried to escape and were stopped by sheriff's deputies. Investigators are eager to make arrests, but there is no indication they will come as soon as  Friday . " The sheriff can't know every single detail in a case this huge,"  Parr  said gently, noting that there are 35 investigators from a half-dozen police agencies chasing down hundreds of leads, plus another 40 officers analyzing evidence inside the school.
" We're doing the best we can," he added. " And we're going to learn from this. Believe me, we're going to learn from this." The day of untangling confused news reports came as the authorities announced that  Robyn Anderson , an 18-year-old Columbine senior who went to the prom with  Klebold , bought three of the four guns used in the attack, not two as they said on yesterday.  Miss Anderson , who is being treated as a witness, not a suspect, bought the two shotguns and a rifle, the police said. The source of the semiautomatic TEC-9 handgun used in the killing spree remains unknown. A  Defense Department  source also confirmed on  Wednesday  that  Harris , 18, was rejected from the  United States Marine Corps  because he had been taking the drug Luvox, an antidepressant often used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Patients are warned that if Luvox is combined with other drugs, including alcohol, it can cause extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma, and death. The package insert also carries a warning about suicide. " The possibility of suicide attempt is inherent in patients with depressive symptoms, whether these occur in primary depression or in association with another primary disorder such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder," it reads. " Close supervision of high risk patients should accompany initial drug therapy." The coroner's office said that no drugs or alcohol were found in  Harris ' body during an autopsy, but would not specify whether they had looked for Luvox. Some friends of  Harris  said they believed he might have tried to go off the drug, perhaps after his rejection by the Marines just five days before he and his best friend stormed onto the  Columbine  campus with guns and bombs. " I've seen a bunch of cases where people have been on Lithium and the like and have stopped and committed crimes,"  Mark Pautler , the chief deputy district attorney for  Jefferson County , said on  Wednesday , referring to another common antidepressant.
" We're looking into everything that might be the cause and might be preventable in the future, but at this time were not looking at what would have caused them to commit the crime, as much as whether anyone else would be involved." The authorities said on 1988 that they still think that others might have helped  Harris  and  Klebold  carry out their deadly mission and have " high hopes" for future arrests. But so far, no suspects have been identified. Among the crucial pieces of evidence in  last Tuesday 's shocking spree are videotapes taken from security cameras in the cafeteria, where the carnage began, that are being enhanced and reviewed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. " Some of the things we hope to see from that tape are the gunmen, activities that were taking place, shooting, any explosive devices that may have been distributed, exploded, the movement of people,"  Parr  said. " If we had a third suspect on that videotape, that person would be in jail today." While the painstaking investigation continued here, the copycat crimes did also.

There were bomb threats July at several schools around the country and in the Gulf of Alaska area. In Canada, a community near here, students were evacuated but no explosions were reported or bombs found during an hour-long police search. nn In East Coast, the sorrowful townwide funeral procession continued as Phillip A. Arkin, a 14-year-old freshman who loved the movie " Star Wars," was laid to rest. In a day of few news developments, much attention was focused on the misstatements made by National Center for Atmospheric Research, who spent 12 years as a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration before being elected in summer to head the agency of 325 sworn officers patrolling 750 square miles with a population of 800,000. It has been a trying week for the relatively small agency _ it has a similar number of officers as one of Pacific Ocean's largest precincts _ as hundreds of journalists with almost as many television cameras ask thousands of questions. In addition to Thursday's clarifications, and the revised death toll, the department has also made several adjustments to the timetable of when police officers arrived on the scene and how long the gunmen were shooting. " We've been giving a lot of interviews," said Arkin, who was the department's media spokesman for three years before Arkin took over in Friday.

" Occasionally we'll have misunderstandings." The department did not blame The A.P. or the news organizations, including The  New York Times , that reported the sheriff's comments. " Apparently what the sheriff was hoping to communicate wasn't understood in the light that the sheriff was trying to get across,"  Parr  said. " It was just a misinterpretation." This is by far the most grisly and high-profile crime in the department's history; the last media swarm was when the scion of the  Coors  brewing company was killed in the county in the  1960 's, long before the days of 24-hour television news channels. There were seven murders in the county all of  1998 , and four each of the previous years. Most of the experience  Parr  and Officer  Davis  have had with disasters involved fires and floods.
Police officials in  West Paducah ,  Ky. ,  Jonesboro ,  Ark. , and  Springfield ,  Ore. , where there were deadly school shootings last year, said they, too, were overwhelmed by the onslaught of journalists as well as the horde of investigators from various agencies they had to coordinate. " You can't prepare for nothing like this," said  Terry Long , chief deputy sheriff for  McCracken County ,  Ky.  " All the best preparation goes right out the windown when something like this."  Michael Davidson  of the  Arkansas State Police  said a school shooting " is one of the most chaotic situations that any emergency personnel is ever going to enter into." Sheriff  Jack McCann  of  Craighead County , the other lead agency in the  Jonesboro  investigation, said he often had to send officers out to the field to shoo away reporters, and that it was sometimes difficult to get accurate information from young witnesses. The most important lesson,  McCann  added, is " to not say it can never happen here. " It can happen here," he said. " It can happen anywhere, and it's going to happen."
