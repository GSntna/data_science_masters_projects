Cruising at 33,000 feet,  EgyptAir  Flight 990 was " uneventful" until the plane's autopilot disconnected about 8 seconds before the jetliner, with 217 people aboard, began to drop down toward the  Atlantic Ocean , crash investigators said  Wednesday . It is not yet clear whether the autopilot disconnected by itself or was turned off by the crew of the Cairo-bound jet that was some 40 minutes out of  New York 's  Kennedy Airport  at the time.  National Transportation Safety Board  Chairman  Jim Hall , releasing the first tidbits of information that his investigators have gleaned from examining one of the jet's two black boxes, said the  Boeing  767 made what appears to be a " controlled descent" from 33,000 feet down to 19,000 feet. The flight data recorder stopped shortly afterward and the final five to 10 seconds of information on its tape are still being analyzed,  Hall  told a news conference at the safety board's headquarters in  Washington ,  D.C.  All aboard the jet died when it crashed into the  Atlantic  less than two minutes after the autopilot disconnected.. Although the information made public so far raises still more questions about what could have gone wrong on Flight 990,  Hall  did say investigators do not believe the jet's thrust reversers deployed in flight. One of the thrust reversers on the twin-engine 767, which are used to slow a jet after landing, had been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left  Cairo  for  New York , and there has been speculation that perhaps a thrust reverser deployed during flight.
That speculation was fueled because another 767 crashed in  Thailand  in  1991  when a thrust reverser deployed in flight. The  Lauda Air  crash killed all 223 people on board. " There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have,"  Hall  said of  EgyptAir  Flight 990. The safety board is expected to release more information from the flight data recorder over the coming days. The  Navy  is still trying to recover the second black box _ the cockpit voice recorder. It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet's cockpit during the final 30 minutes of flight, and could prove to be even more important than the flight data recorder in helping investigators determine the cause of the crash.
A former 767 pilot told the  Seattle   Post-Intelligencer last night  the jet may have experienced an in-flight electrical or computer problem, based on the limited amount of information made public so far by the safety board. The autopilot on a 767 would disconnect from flying the airplane if there there were a problem with the cockpit computers or the plane's electrical system, said  Dan Gellert  of  Sequim , a former pilot with  Eastern Airlines  who later trained 767 pilots. A light would flash and an alarm would sound to let the crew know immediately that the autopilot was off, he said. The 767 has a modern " glass cockpit," and information about the plane, including its altitude and attitude ( or angle of flight ), are displayed on screens in front of the crew. An electrical or computer problem would cause those screens to go blank, or could even result in erroneous flight data to be displayed,  Gellert  said. The pilots, believing they were still in level flight, could have put the big jet into a dive, he theorized.
An electrical problem would also explain why the plane's transponder stopped working, he said. The transponder sends out an electronic signal that tells air traffic controllers the plane's altitude. Until  Wednesday , the only information about what happened to  EgyptAir  Flight 990 had come from an analysis of radar data by the  NTSB  and the  Air Force . Safety board investigators said  last week  the radar analysis showed the jet, flying at 33,000 feet, suddenly entered a steep but straight dive down to 16,700 feet. At that point, air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane's transponder. But  Air Force  radar continued to plot the plane's course and altitude down to 16,000 feet.
The jet climbed back to 24,000 feet before making a rapid descent to 10,000 feet. At that point, radar showed multiple targets, indicating the plane broke up before it hit the ocean. The transponder operates on a separate electrical buss, or pathway, from the plane's computers and autopilot,  Gellert  said. That would explain why it kept working longer, assuming an electrical problem caused the autopilot to disconnect. Based on preliminary analysis, investigators had said last week that early in its 17,000-foot dive, the plane may have exceeded the speed of sound, though it began to slow as it neared 16,000 feet. But  Hall  said Monday the flight data recorder indicates the plane did not reach such speeds.

Even so, the 767 did dive much faster than it would have in an emergency. Based on the radar analysis, the jet took 40 second to reach 16,700 feet, which would have meant it was going down at more than 24,000 feet per minute. A El Cajon spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible. Washington Moscuso said pilots are trained to bank a commercial jetliner about 30 degree before making an emergency descent. That is to keep the passengers from flying out of their seats in a steep dive.

Centrifugal force during the turn presses passengers into their seats. Investigators have said the radar data shows the plane did not turn in its initial dive. Neither the pilot nor co-pilot of  EgyptAir  Flight 990 radioed any kind of distress call to air traffic controllers. Their last contact with controllers a few minutes before the plane began its descent did not indicate any problem.  Gellert  said an electrical problem could have knocked out communications, or the crew might have been preoccupied trying to regain control of their airplane. Hall did not comment  Wednesday  on how the airplane behaved after the brief climb shown by radar data, or in its final plunge to the ocean.
 That subsequent climb is consistent with a loss of the computers,  Gellert  said. " Somewhere along the way you realize you are diving, then you try and recover," he said. " Perhaps the crew overcorrected. Now they are zooming back up, putting the plane on its tail. Then they lose control again and head down and start shedding parts."
