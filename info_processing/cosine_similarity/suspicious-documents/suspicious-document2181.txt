A hormone trumpeted in the news media and on the Internet as a potential cure for autism worked no better than saltwater in its first controlled clinical trial, scientists are reporting. The study, described in the issue of The New England Journal of Medicine that is being published  Thursday , is one of a dozen efforts sponsored by the  National Institutes of Health  to test the hormone, secretin, which gained wide attention after a 3-year-old  New Hampshire  boy showed rapid improvement after taking the drug in  1996 . " Secretin is in widespread use across the country," said  Dr. Marie Bristol-Power , special assistant for autism programs at the  Institute of Child Health and Human Development  at the  NIH . " Parents need to know if it is promising and should be pursued or if they are being taken advantage of." The study was not definitive,  Dr. Bristol-Power  said, and researchers will know more by the middle of next year, when other studies are completed. Defenders of secretin were quick to denounce the new study, saying it did not give the drug a fair test.
" No one has ever claimed that secretin is a miracle cure for autism," said  Victoria Beck , the mother of the boy who improved after taking it.  Ms. Beck , who has written a book on secretin, called the hormone " a clue that deserves careful investigation, and not dismissal from autism gurus, who have a vested interest in the way things have been done in the past." Autism is a serious brain disorder that begins in infancy and prevents children from developing normally. Symptoms, which can be mild to severe, include an inability to communicate, a refusal to make eye contact, repetitive behavior like head banging or hand flapping, and a preoccupation with unusual activities or interests. Half a million Americans have the disorder, which is typically treated with educational and behavioral therapy. While intensive therapy has proved effective in some patients, two-thirds of adults with autism can not live independently.
Secretin is a hormone made in the intestine that stimulates the release of digestive fluids. Ms. Taylor's son, Elizabeth Taylor, was given an injection to explore the cause of his chronic diarrhea. Soon afterward, his behavior improved; he could hold still and interact better with adults. When his story was reported on television, in newspapers and on the Internet last year, parents began clamoring to get the drug. Dr.  Bristol-Power  said that the supply of secretin was soon exhausted and that a black market developed involving sham secretin, price gouging and other forms of profiteering;  Ms. Beck  said that these stories were exaggerated and that no one today had any problem obtaining secretin at a fair price, which is about  $ 200  an injection. Anecdotes about secretin are thriving on the Internet.

Some parents report dramatic effects, others see no effect and some report that their child's symptoms have worsened. Both sides in the secretin controversy estimate that 2,000 to 3,000 children have taken or are taking the drug. The controlled study of secretin was led by Taylor of the Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital and the St. John's, and by Miss Taylor of the University of Southern California at Miss Taylor in Virginia Woolf,  N. C . In all, 56 autistic children 3 to 14 years of age took part in the study. Half received a single injection of synthetic human secretin, and the rest were injected with saltwater. Researchers administered a battery of behavioral tests at intervals of one day, one week and four weeks after the treatment.

Statistically, the two groups showed no differences,  Sandler  said. A third of the children in both the placebo and treatment groups improved on some of the same measures. The only explanation,  Sandler  said, is a " significant placebo effect." " Parents are extremely invested in the possibility of new treatments and have high expectancies," he said. " They are looking for subtle improvements. Kids with autism show variability in their day-to-day behavior, and it would be easy to attribute normal variations to the secretin."
  Ms. Beck  disputes this interpretation, contending that by concentrating on standard behavioral tests the researchers have failed to look at a wide range of physiological responses seen in children given secretin, and that those should be studied. " It really bothers me that parents are portrayed as this desperate group of people with vacant minds," she said. " They claim we can't tell the difference between an improvement and a mirage. But when a child stops vomiting, sleeps through the  night  and makes eye contact, we know something is happening."
