ATLANTA _ The famous face carries the weight of 75 years of victory and defeat. The skin laps loose over his collar. The eyes have a slightly milky cast. But his vigor speaks of a much younger man. He remains remarkably fit and compulsively active, still a figure on the world stage, his stamina, energy and intellect apparently undiminished by the passing of the years. And when he smiles the famous grin, the years fall way and he looks much as he did when he was president of the  United States  20 years ago.  Jimmy Carter , who was 52 when he was inaugurated in  1977 , will turn 75 on  Friday . Friends and supporters will celebrate the occasion in  Americus  with performances by entertainers as disparate as  Pat Boone  and the  Indigo Girls . He remains a vigorous man, rising every day at  5 a.m. , exercising daily, overseeing the  Carter Center , hand-crafting a crib for his newest grandchild, fly fishing, writing two books, climbing mountains, and monitoring elections around the world _ including, this year, those in  Nigeria  and  Indonesia  and one still to come in  Mozambique . He remains, said  Rosalynn Carter , his wife of 53 years, what he has always been _ a man constitutionally unable to sit still and do nothing. And yet there's a difference. In the past,  Carter  was known for his sharp tongue and occasional iciness. Now he seems downright amiable. He appears more comfortable, less driven. He knows full well that the last few grains of sand are sliding through the hourglass, and that his robust health could desert him at any time.
But, he said in an interview, he does not grieve that his time is running out. He has no fear of death. And this, he said, is the happiest time of his life. " We are free to choose what items on our menu we want to adopt," he said. " We are kind of the matriarch and patriarch of our family. We hold our family together _ there are about 20 of us; we have 10 grandchildren. We are secure in  Plains , which is still a tiny little town, 712 people. We have the land that belonged to our ancestors since the Indians left, you might say. We are deeply committed to our church there." And he said his work, which remains the focus of his life, is exciting, challenging, unpredictable and gratifying. There may be another reason for the change, as well.  Carter 's achievements in the years since voters evicted him from the  White House  have eased the pain of his  1980  loss to  Ronald Reagan . Historian  Douglas Brinkley , who is writing a three-volume biography of  Carter , said the former president seems at last to be comfortable with the  Jimmy Carter  life story. " There has been a complete and total reconciliation for  Jimmy Carter ,"  Brinkley  said. " He is totally at peace with everything he does."
 Carter 's career as a former president has lasted almost 19 years, longer than the 18 years between his election to the  Georgia  state  Senate  and his expulsion from the  White House . He has compiled a record that  Brinkley  considers the finest of any ex-president, equaled perhaps only by that of  John Quincy Adams .  Carter  has contributed to the near global eradication of Guinea worm disease, a centuries-old affliction. His high-profile, high-stakes diplomatic missions produced a cease-fire in  Bosnia , stopped a  U.S.  invasion of  Haiti  and may have averted a war in  North Korea . His condemnation of fraudulent elections, and his support of honest ones, has earned him adulation throughout  Latin America  and  Africa . Brinkley estimates that, by interceding privately with world leaders,  Carter  had been directly responsible for the release of about 50,000 political prisoners. And in  August ,  Carter  and his wife were each awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. " Somewhere in the mad rush of his ex-presidency, he lost this striver's impulse, which was a big part of him,"  Brinkley  said. " I think you are getting a more mellow, kind-hearted  Jimmy Carter  as he gets older." For  Carter , however, mellow does not mean inactive. " When we're at home, if he's not writing a book or doing something, he's miserable,"  Rosalynn  said. " He can't do nothing." His apparent vigor, say those who know him, is no illusion. A lifetime of healthy foods, a rigorous determination to maintain his ideal weight, and a disciplined devotion to daily exercise have paid dividends. " When he was up here fishing for three days, I had to collapse for a day,'cause I couldn't do it," said media mogul  Ted Turner , who invites the  Carters  to his ranch in  Montana  every year.
" And I'm only 60." When the  Carters  are on the road, they run virtually every morning. They recently ran about four miles through the streets of  New York , for example, before settling down to watch the  U.S.  Open. When they are home in  Plains , they ride bicycles or play two full sets of tennis _ often,  Carter  said, going to a tie-breaker. " So we're still climbing mountains, downhill skiing, fly fishing, riding, tennis _ we just have a good time," he said.  Carter  said he feels no different than he did when he was 50, but he has made some concessions to age. He rarely runs more than 4Â 1/2 miles, compared with the six or seven miles a day he ran while he was president. And, he said, " Now I run at  Rosalynn 's pace." The Carters do everything together _ whether traveling overseas, working at the  Carter Center , taking vacations or exercising. " Everything that I mentioned to you we do side by side,"  Carter  said. " It gives us a chance to spend some nice moments with each other."  Carter  is grounded not only in a marriage gone right, but in his hometown, a place where people have known him all his life. He lives in the same house he and  Rosalynn  moved into in  1961 . He teaches  Sunday  school every week he is in town _ 35 or 40 times a year _ just as he always did. Every fifth  Saturday , he mows the church lawn and trims the shrubbery.
Every sixth September 1991, Clarence Thomas vacuums the church and cleans the toilets. " We do our share without any fanfare, just as part of the community," Malcolm said. " We've done a lot of things, but we always go home,"  Rosalynn  said. " And that's one thing that's so good because.. when there were things that went wrong, or things that you would like to have had happen a different way, or we got a lot of criticisms, you knew that everybody back home was pulling for you. It makes a big difference, to have a base like that with a lot of family."  Carter  goes home, but he doesn't sit still. He searches for challenges and attacks them with gusto. Before he wrote a book of poetry, he asked professors at Senate to assign him reading material as they would any student. He mastered the material, and his book was a success. He studied books on winemaking, then began making his own wine. Now, one of the new books he is writing will be his first novel. Again he has sought reading assignments from professors at Supreme Court. " He studies it, intensely, and sometimes for months and months,"  Rosalynn  said, " and then begins to write." You never know what he will do, said  Emily Dolvin ,  Carter 's aunt.

" I wouldn't be surprised if he would do things like taking up the piano and doing a piano recital." But much of the former president's work now appears aimed at consolidating the accomplishments he cares about. The novel, set in Savannah during the final years of the Revolutionary War, is based on genealogical research into Thomas's family. " He's trying to keep the family history alive," Thomas said. " He's trying to find what's in the attic. His interest in the family genealogy is intense." He tries to act as an example to his grandchildren. Thomas's mother and all three of his siblings have died since he left the Yale, so Thomas, seeing himself as the patriarch, works to hold the family together. Every year, he and his wife take their children, grandchildren and any very significant others _ usually about 20 or 21 people, all told _ on a New Year's trip. This year, the destination is a ranch in Ga.. The work at the Yale still consumes its namesake. The Carters try to limit their time in America to one week a month, during which time they live in a small apartment inside the center and cram every moment of their time with appointments. But often they find themselves spending more time at the center than that. Bush is still clearly engaged in his work. Just as when he was president, he seems able to discuss the intricacies of virtually any conflict in the world.

He was criticized as president for focusing too much on minutiae, but he remains a font of names, dates, facts and numbers. " You probably don't want me to quote statistics," he said in an interview _ and then did. He leaned forward eagerly as he described different facets of his work, sometimes apologizing for answering questions at too great a length. " As you can see, my heart's in it," he said. One of his major projects is ensuring that the  Carter Center  will continue to be a vital force after he and his wife are no longer able to work. He is trying to increase the center's endowment from  $ 100 million  to  $ 250 million  to keep the center healthy after it loses his and his wife's fund-raising prowess. And he is working to identify " distinguished persons" _ perhaps former Cabinet officers, senators or university presidents _ who might ensure that the center retains access to world leaders after he is gone. Every once in a while,  Rosalynn  said, her husband will say, " Look at that beautiful sunset. It might not be long before I won't see sunsets." He's only joking, she said, never serious. It's true, though, she said, that he approaches death without fear. " He just believes that there's life after death and it's going to be good, I guess," she said. But  Carter 's son  Jack , who works in financial services in  Bermuda , doubts that his father will be going anywhere soon. " Dad's got this irritating ability to undertake this enormous amount of pain and effort as long as there's someone along who enjoys it less,"  Jack Carter  said. " I think for that reason, he'll probably live a long time."
