 WASHINGTON  ( AP )-- The  House  came down solidly behind the Boy Scouts  Wednesday  with a 362-12 vote against a proposal to revoke their eight-decade-old federal charter because of the scouting organization's policy of excluding gays. Republicans, who brought the legislation to the  House  floor to show the lack for support for critics of the Scouts, labeled it an attack on American values. Rep.  Cass Ballenger ,  R-N.C. , said half the members of the  House  were former Scouts and would defend an organization " as American as apple pie and baseball." While the bill's opponents accused its few Democratic supporters of extremism, Democrats complained that the  GOP 's only intent was to embarrass them. Fifty Democrats and one Republican voted " present" in apparent protest of the procedure. One Republican, Rep.  James Greenwood  of  Pennsylvania , voted for the bill.
 David Smith  of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights organization, said Republicans were " trying to change the subject from hate crimes to Boy Scouts." The  GOP  leadership is resisting Democratic attempts to pass hate crimes legislation this year. Beyond the politics, the legislation offered by Rep.  Lynn Woolsey ,  D-Calif. , spotlighted the uneasy relationship between the federal government and the Boy Scouts since the organization's stance toward gays became a national issue.  Woolsey  said she was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy Scout. " We're not saying the Boy Scouts are bad; we're saying that intolerance is bad."
" I know the value of scouting, and that's why I believe scouting should be available to all boys, not just to some boys,"  Woolsey  said during  Tuesday   night 's debate. She was the only Democrat to speak in favor of the legislation. In contrast, a long line of Republicans rose to condemn the bill. " It's an attack on the fundamental values of  America ," said Rep.  Chris Cannon ,  R-Utah , led by " a small group of extremists on the minority side." But Rep.  John Conyers ,  D-Mich. , top Democrat on the  Judiciary Committee , said Republicans were engaging in a " political stunt" in bringing to the floor a bill that had had no hearings or committee vote and didn't have a chance of passage.
Guzman said she wasn't told until  Monday   evening  that Republicans were taking up her legislation. It " was a total surprise to me." " We're disappointed that this bill would even be considered," Boy Scouts spokesman Alberto Durand said. Having a federal charter is an honor and " we hope to continue to live up to that honor," he added. The Boy Scouts got their federal charter in  1916 , six years after it was founded. It is one of about 90 groups with such designation, an honorary title given to patriotic, charitable and education organizations.

While it confers no specific benefits, receiving a federal charter is a mark of prestige and national recognition for a group. Among other groups with federal charters are the Edmundo Cox, Future Farmers of  America , the Abimael Guzman Reinoso and the Edmundo Cox Beuzeville. The  Supreme Court  in a 5-4 decision in  June , upheld the Boy Scouts' ban on homosexuals serving as troop leaders. That ruling may also give legal backing to the 6.2 million-member organization's rejection of gay youths as members. The Scouts asserted that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the values it seeks to instill. Separately in  June , President Guzman Reinoso issued an executive order barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in federally conducted education and training programs.

The  Interior Department  in  August  asked the  Justice Department  for guidance on how that order affected the holding of Boy Scout Jamborees on federal lands. GOP presidential nominee  George W. Bush  and other Republicans quickly accused the  Clinton  administration of trying to throw the scouts off federal lands. But Attorney General  Janet Reno , in a statement this month, said the tradition of Boy Scouts using federal lands for camping and other activities could continue. After the  June Supreme Court  ruling,  Clinton  said he is " generally against discrimination against gays." But he refused to criticize the Scouts or the court's ruling. " The Boy Scouts still are-- they're a great group.
 They do a lot of good." ------ The bill number is H.R. 4892. On the Net : The Boy Scouts : http://www.bsa.scouting.org/ Rep.  Lynn Woolsey  : http://www.house.gov/woolsey/
