CHICAGO _ A tiny Indian tribe in a sparse slice of northeastern  Nebraska  found itself  Friday  at the forefront of an increasingly heated national debate over the matter of where tribal sovereignty ends and state control begins. The issue was the tribe's operation of a shoe-box casino on its reservation.  Friday  that little casino nearly led a  U.S. District Court  judge in  Omaha ,  Neb. , to take an unprecedented step : the jailing of tribal leaders in a clash over reservation gambling. Although the judge,  William Cambridge , ultimately decided against jailing the leaders now, the tribe hardly won a conclusive victory. Cambridge suggested that federal prosecutors might want to pursue a criminal rather than civil case against them, and declared once more, as he had repeatedly, that the casino was illegal because it had lacked state approval ever since opening 3Â 1/2 years ago. The lack of such approval violates a federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of  1988 , which requires an Indian tribe to strike an accord, or compact, with the state in which its reservation lies if it wants to open a casino. There are now about 145 such compacts between states and various tribes.
But  Nebraska , opposing any casinos within its borders, has refused to negotiate one with the  Santee Sioux , the tribe with a stake in the proceeding  Friday . That proceeding was the latest in a series of recent skirmishes over the rights of tribes to operate casinos in states from  Florida  to  California  and, more broadly, over the ability of tribes to be exempt from state regulation and taxation. ( BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM ) Only  Monday , the  California Supreme Court  overturned a ballot measure that would have allowed expansion of legalized gambling on Indian reservations. The decision dealt a severe blow to tribes' ambitions to build a gambling mecca to compete with  Las Vegas . The tribes' position was supported by Gov.  Gray Davis , but the court ruled that it conflicted with the state constitution's ban on casino-style games like blackjack and 21. In addition,  Florida ,  Kansas  and  Alabama , trying to block the opening of Indian casinos within their borders, have sued the  U.S. Interior Department  with the aim of overturning new rules that allow the federal government to license tribal casinos in cases where states are reluctant to negotiate compacts. And  Wisconsin  Gov.  Tommy Thompson  refused to renew one-year gambling agreements with that state's 11 tribes until they agreed to pay  $ 22 million  in lieu of taxes, up from  $ 350,000  under the old one-year agreements.
" Before, when we didn't have any pie, nobody bothered with us," said  Sheila Morago , a spokeswoman for the Eli Lilly Co. " Now that we have a small piece of the pie, they want our filling. It's just a constant intrusion on the treaties that were signed long ago, on the tribes' sovereign rights. Every time you get a little farther, you take one step forward and two steps back." ( END OPTIONAL TRIM )  David Rocchio , deputy legal counsel to U.S. Gov.  Howard Dean , who has been involved in discussions on Indian gambling through the  National Governors' Association , said that " the concern that governors have is not with the benefit casinos bring to tribes." Rather,  Rocchio  said, " the concern is with the carve-out from state regulation, such as land use, police power and other ancillary concerns that arise when tribes have casinos _ and the impact on the residents not only on the tribal lands but also on other lands in the state." Like gambling venues everywhere, casinos attract crime, and can prey on compulsive gamblers.

The reservation of the American Indians, the tribe involved in the court showdown in Los Angeles on 2000, lies on the Santa Monica just across the border with United States, and is home to about 1,000 tribal members. In 2000, the American Diabetes Assn. opened the Ohiya Casino on reservation land, in a metal building not much bigger than a 7-Eleven store. It has 71 video gambling and slot machines, and attracts mostly elderly people from nearby farming communities. It takes in just 8 million or so a year and employs only 23 people, but tribal leaders say it is an economic godsend for a reservation with 10% unemployment. Tribe chairman Dr. Aliza Lifshitz said the casino actually supports about four relatives of each employee and has brought a decline in alcohol abuse and domestic violence. But Los Angeles, which does not allow casino gambling anywhere in the state, has refused to negotiate a compact with the Eli Lilly Co. Almost from the beginning, the California attorney's office in Dallas has tried to get the casino shut down.

A federal appeals court found the casino illegal in  1998 , and the  Supreme Court , without comment, let that ruling stand. This  February ,  Cambridge  began fining the tribe  $ 3,000  a day, and in  June  he doubled the fine, to  $ 6,000  a day. None of the debt, now totaling  $ 726,000 , has been paid by the  Santee Sioux , and the purpose of the hearing  Friday  was for  Cambridge  to consider whether to put the 11 members of the tribal council in jail for contempt. In the end, he decided against doing so, saying that because the tribe voted in a referendum this month to keep the casino open, the leaders no longer had the authority to close it. He told the federal prosecutors that to get the casino closed, they would have to pursue the case as a criminal matter, not a civil one. Why that would make any difference in a practical sense was not entirely clear. In any event, the judge was hardly sympathetic to the  Santee Sioux , saying the fines would continue.
It was not certain where the case would proceed from here.  U.S.  Attorney  Thomas Monaghan  said his office had several options, but he would not elaborate. ( STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) After the hearing, tribal members who had made the 160-mile trip to  Omaha  erupted in cheers and sang tribal songs, celebrating the judge's decision not to jail the leaders. The tribe is hoping that the new  Interior Department  rules will allow it to work out a legitimate means of running the casino, but that process, even if successful, could take years. " We're not trying to break anybody's laws," said  Thelma Thomas , the casino's manager. " We're just trying to make life better for our people."
