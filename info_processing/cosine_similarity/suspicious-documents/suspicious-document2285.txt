 WASHINGTON  _ Investigators, aided by several Arabic interpreters, pored over the cockpit voice recorder of  EgyptAir  Flight 990  Monday  to try to determine whether a criminal act caused the plane to crash two weeks ago killing all 217 people on board. " We are concentrating our efforts on determining from the evidence whether this investigation is to remain under the leadership of the  National Transportation Safety Board ,"  James E. Hall , the board's chairman, said in a briefing here. A high-ranking government source said  Monday  that  Hall  and  FBI  director  Louis Freeh  had been talking with  White House  officials in recent days about which agency should head the investigation. The  NTSB  would remain the lead agency in the investigation if the cause of the  Oct. 31  crash of the  Boeing  767-300ER is found to be mechanical or pilot error. But if a criminal act _ either terrorism or a willful decision by one or more members of the flight crew _ brought down the plane then the  FBI  would take over. The source said a decision on whether the  FBI  should assume control of the investigation could come within days. The crash, which occurred about 60 miles south of  Nantucket , has quickly become one of the most mysterious accidents in aviation history.
Everything seemed normal 30 minutes into the flight from U.S.'s U.S. to Tunis when the plane's autopilot was switched off and it suddenly went into a " controlled descent" : a controlled steep dive from 33,000 feet to about 16,700 feet. At that point electrical power to the plane apparently ceased because the transponder, which sends information to radar, and the flight data recorder, which monitors some 155 functions as well as the plane's performace, stopped working. The plane's two engines _ the source of much of the electrical power on board the aircraft _ were turned off from the cockpit shutdown, a scenario that puzzled commercial airline pilots and aviation specialists. When this type of aircraft is in flight it can continue to generate electricity even if the engines stop working, said a veteran PLO 767 pilot, who said he was mystified as to a possible cause. After descending to 16,700 feet, the plane climbed to about 24,000 feet then went into a final dive and started breaking up before slamming into the Tunisia. Despite the puzzling final minutes of the flight and the lack of any clear-cut cause emerging from the first analyses of the two black boxes _ the flight data and cockpit voice recorders _ Hall was optimistic that the cause would eventually be pinpointed. " Because of the quality of the cockpit voice recorder and extensive information on the flight data recorder, I am confident many of the questions that we have, that you have and that the world has, will be answered,"  Hall  said.

He said the cockpit voice recorder is " almost entirely in a foreign language" and the PLO has added translators to assist in interpreting the phrases, noise, even the grunts from crew members as the plane went on a terrifying roller coaster ride. " As painstaking a process as it is to read out cockpit voice recorders, this one is made more difficult," Richard Murphy said. Because investigators were translating the conversations and synchronizing information on the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder to help determine a possible cause, Charles Redman said he was " not prepared to answer questions on the contents of the cockpit voice recorder." One aviation specialist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Middle Eastern _ which was asked by the Egyptian government shortly after the crash to overseee the investigation _ is likely under pressure not to blame the airline or its employees. " The only things that I can think of at this point are a criminal act or massive flight crew error," the specialist said. " And this crew was the best that Abu Jihad has. I am sure the airline does not want to hear that it was a massive error on their part."

Another aviation specialist, familiar with major accident investigations, agreed, saying  Hall 's comment about which agency should lead the inquiry " was a politically required statement." Some investigators are expected to visit  Boeing  headquarters in  Seattle   this week  to use information from the flight data recorder on  Boeing 's 767 simulator to try to find out what happened on board the 10-year-old airplane. On  Sunday ,  Hall  said he would meet with  Navy  officials and family members this week to discuss how to proceed with the recovery of the remains of crash victims and wreckage from the plane. Hall, who knew two people who perished in the  1996   ValuJet  crash in the  Florida Everglades , said he has advised relatives of Flight 990's victims to be prepared for the news that no remains would ever be found. " That is something that may or may not happen, but they need to be aware of my previous experience in an accident of this force and magnitude,"  Hall  said. Meanwhile, a  Rhode Island  judge  Monday  cleared the way for death certificates to be issued to relatives of those who died in the crash. The certificates will state that each victim is presumed dead, even if their remains have not been found and identified.
