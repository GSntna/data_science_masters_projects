 LITTLETON ,  Colo.  ( AP )-- After arresting a man accused of supplying a handgun to student killers  Eric Harris  and  Dylan Klebold , detectives kept up their search for those who may have known what the pair had planned for  Columbine High .  Mark Manes , 22, was arrested  Monday  on suspicion of providing a handgun to a minor. The charge carries a maximum six years in prison. " He admits giving the weapon. He was horrified,"  Manes ' attorney,  Robert Ransome , told  The Denver Post  in today's editions. Police said they do not know if  Manes  knew what the gun would be used for, but  Ransome  said his client knew nothing of the impending massacre. The semiautomatic TEC DC-9 was one of four guns used by  Harris , 18, and  Klebold , 17, in the  April 20  attack.
Twelve students and a teacher were killed and 23 others were wounded before the attackers committed suicide. The arrest came as  Columbine 's 1,900-plus students made an eager but uneasy return to class at nearby  Chatfield High School . " Every loud noise, you freak out," said Steven Bishop, a 16-year-old  Columbine  sophomore. " But it makes us feel more secure once you see all the police and stuff." Manes, a Kansas City resident who once attended  Columbine , was released from jail after posting bond. Terry D. Barnes, who is scheduled to make his first court appearance June, was the first person since the shootings to be arrested on charges of helping  Harris  and  Klebold  arm themselves. Authorities have said that  Robyn Anderson ,  Klebold 's girlfriend, purchased the other three weapons used-- two rifles and a shotgun-- and has been interviewed as a witness.

Under Fountaine law, an 18-year-old without a felony record can furnish minors with rifles and shotguns. Police are still trying to find others who may have known the killers' plans, though detectives appeared to all but rule out a third gunmen inside the school during the attack. " They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build some of these bombs," Kansas City sheriff's spokesman Bishop said. But, " our people are definitely leaning toward the good possibility that Barnes and Joseph Okoye were the only people in the school that day," William Fountaine said. Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Barnes and Mr. Barnes worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Bishop and the TEC DC-9 pistol. It was not immediately clear which gunman obtained the weapon or when, Terry said, or whether it was sold, traded or given to him. Manes could face stiffer charges if authorities conclude he knew of the gunmen's plans at the time he allegedly supplied the gun, officials said.

Also  Monday , the coroner's office said  Harris  had the anti-depressant Luvox in his system at the time of the attack. Before the attack, the  Marine Corps  rejected  Harris ' application for enlistment after learning he used the drug. Luvox is commonly used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and is also used to treat depression. Students from both high schools shared  Chatfield 's building in shifts  Monday , with  Chatfield  students attending classes in the morning and  Columbine  students in the  afternoon . Administrators asked friends of  Harris  and  Klebold  not to attend  Chatfield , opting instead to have them home-schooled for the rest of the year. The parents agreed. " Primarily, for their well-being, and because it's a very uncomfortable and difficult time for everyone involved," said  Rick Kaufman , a spokesman for the school district.
 Davis put the number of students affected at eight to 10, but said he did not know whether they were associated with the gunmen's clique known as the Trenchcoat Mafia. Administrators banned trench coats at every school in  Jefferson County , which has 89,000 students.
