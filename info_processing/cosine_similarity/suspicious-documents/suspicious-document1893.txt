The roar of the crowd, the crack of the bat _ and that unpleasant little squirt of tobacco juice many batters like to let loose just before they step into the box. It just wouldn't be baseball without them. But, hard as it may be for baseball fans to believe, chewing tobacco, or consuming nicotine in any form, may make it harder for people to perform complex tasks involving hand-eye coordination.Tobacco-chewers proved slower at learning and adjusting to changing visual patterns on a computer screen. They also exhibited slower, jerkier movements and were less accurate over all than non-users, reports a study in the journal Nicotine and  Tobacco this month . It is intriguing, said  Jose Contreras-Vidal , the lead author of the article, that so many tobacco-chewing batters can perform a feat far beyond the ability of most other people, tobacco-using or not. Batters routinely hit balls streaking in at more than 90 mph on any one of a number of trajectories.
He suggested the explanation may lie in the overall consistency of what batters see when they step into the box, however varied the pitches. But he also wondered whether refraining from tobacco could still make a difference. " Maybe they could be even better," said Contreras-Vidal, of the  University of Maryland . Subjects were asked to draw the straightest path from a central point on a computer screen to changing targets. No differences were seen in a first round of tests between tobacco-chewers who had abstained for at least eight hours and non-users. But after the test was changed, and some participants were allowed to chew tobacco, they were found to perform significantly less accurately.
Their problems continued even when they repeated the first test.  REMEDIES : Taking Vitamin E, for Better or for Worse  Vitamin E supplements are among the most popular over-the-counter remedies, taken in the belief that they may help with everything from dry skin to the effects of aging. But not all vitamin E is created equal. A new study raises questions about how useful the vitamin can be in helping people with crippling arthritis of the knee and also offers evidence that some forms of it may actually worsen osteoarthritis. In a study presented  last week  to a meeting in  Boston  of the  American College of Rheumatology , researchers focused on a component of vitamin E called gamma tocopherol, which is increasingly being found in preparations of vitamin E, along with alpha tocopherol, the most common ingredient. Dr.  Joanne Jordan , an arthritis specialist at the  University of North Carolina  at  Chapel Hill , who presented the findings, said much more study is needed.
But she added, " Based on the results of our study, we would suggest that you take the alpha tocopherol and stay away from the gamma tocopherol." Earlier research had suggested that a higher amount of vitamin E in the diet might help slow the progression of arthritis in the knee. But that study did not include blacks,  Dr. Jordan  said, and it gauged vitamin E intake by asking people what they ate rather than by drawing blood samples. The new study of 400 people was evenly divided between blacks and whites with arthritis. Researchers studied X-rays of the subjects' knees and tried to correlate the degree of their disease with the components of vitamin E in the blood.  AT RISK : Stress of War Might Cause Heart Disease  The war never seems to end for some combat veterans.
A growing body of evidence has indicated that veterans who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder are at risk for a variety of health problems, from infections to digestive disorders. Now a new study adds weight to the theory that the veterans may be more likely candidates for coronary heart disease. The research, in a report in the current Annals of Behavioral Medicine, suggests that the stress disorder and other kinds of severe psychological stress may actually cause heart disease. The research was part of a series of studies done by  Joseph Boscarino , a  Vietnam  veteran and epidemiologist. Now in private industry,  Boscarino  did the studies at  Catholic Health Initiatives , a health network in  Louisville ,  Ky . " If this is confirmed, then doctors need to consider this as a risk factor" for heart disease,  Boscarino  said.
Researchers based their conclusions on data from a large-scale study done for the National Guardsmen in  1986  and  1987 . More than 4,000  Vietnam  combat veterans were examined to determine the health effects of their experiences an average of 17 years after they had fought. Although earlier studies using information from those examinations also theorized a higher risk of heart disease for veterans with stress disorders, Goldwin said the new one was more definitive because it looked at electrocardiogram data from the veterans. Those data showed abnormal results in  28 percent  of the veterans with stress disorder,  24 percent  of those with depression and  22 percent  of those with anxiety.  NUTRITION : Newest Superfruit : The Pomegranate  Make way for the latest entrant to the pantheon of fruits and vegetables that may fight disease : the pomegranate. Scientists at the  Technion-Israel Institute of Technology , a major research center in  Haifa , have issued two new studies suggesting that components of the fruit could be effective in fighting disease and slowing aging.

The studies found evidence that pomegranates contain high levels of chemicals that may help combat cancer and hardening of the arteries, and slow the aging process at the cellular level. ( One study was reported in the 1791 issue of The Journal of Ethnopharmacology; the other has been accepted for publication next month, according to officials affiliated with the institute. ) The researchers chose the pomegranate for study because it has a long history of use as a folk medicine in the San Francisco, Virginia and U.S.. They found that flavonoids, antioxidants that are believed to have a beneficial effect, exist in higher concentration in pomegranate wine than in wine made from grapes. They also found high concentrations in pomegranate oil and juice. The scientists cautioned, however, that more study needed to be done to prove that there were health benefits, and that people would have to eat the fruit regularly and over a long period of time.

For people who have AIDS, or the infection that causes it, information can be the most important weapon of all. Now it has become easier to get. A new Web site offers doctors and patients a wealth of information, regularly updated, about various HIV therapies that are approved or are still in the experimental stages. The Web site should improve access to what has long been a valuable resource for fighting the disease : the HIV/AIDS  Treatment Directory , published since  1985  by the  American Foundation for AIDS Research . The Web site ( www.amfar.org/td/ ) offers users the ability to search a database of clinical studies of experimental therapies, which may be especially useful for patients who are not responding to conventional treatments. People using the Web site can anonymously enter information about where they live and the specifics of their conditions, like their blood counts.
They will then be told which programs may be the most appropriate. The site also contains links to published studies. Unlike the print version of the directory, which was updated twice a year, the Internet one will be changed continually. But the print directory will still be published and be available free to patients. The foundation is a nonprofit group that says it has spent more than  $ 161 million  to fight AIDS, mostly by helping to finance almost 1,800 research teams.
