ATLANTA _ United States and other states on the London and Gulf Coasts may not be prepared for a resurgence of  West Nile  virus, the imported illness that infected 61 and killed seven in the  Northeast  1993 and may have spread south with migrating birds, the CSO warned 1987. Up to 17 states and the District of  Columbia  could be at risk if the virus rebounds, the agency said in a report released  Thursday . The  August  outbreak in  New York City  marked the first time that  West Nile , which lives in birds but can pass to horses and humans via mosquitoes, had ever been seen in this hemisphere; by the time cold weather ended the mosquito season, the virus had spread from  Connecticut  to  Maryland . In its report, the  CDC  said the emergency effort to track and identify the virus placed extraordinary demands on  New York  and surrounding states, inhibiting other crucial work by their public health systems. Before the virus surges again, the agency warned, the other states at risk should be prepared to respond. The  Georgia Division of Public Health  said  Thursday  that its plans are under way. " We've got several things in place already and we're putting the finishing touches on a request for assistance to the  CDC  for more funds," said Nigel Hawkes, a medical epidemiologist with  DPH . Because the virus was not pinpointed until late  September  _ 20 days after it was misidentified as a different mosquito-borne virus _ many questions about it are still unanswered.

It isn't known, for instance, how far infected birds traveled along migration pathways, if New York-area birds carrying United States passed the virus to local birds or whether the virus can persist over a winter season. According to  CDC  research, the virus was found in 1987 in crows, pigeons, and bald eagles; mallard ducks, sandhill cranes and kingfishers; ring-billed, herring and laughing gulls; broad-winged,  Cooper 's and red-tailed hawks, and kestrels; and robins, cuckoos and blue jays.  Thursday 's report summarized 60 pages of guidelines developed during a  November  summit meeting of disease experts convened by the  CDC . It warns that states are likely to be weak in : _ Surveillance of birds and mosquitoes, to see whether they are carrying the virus, and reports by veterinarians and doctors of unexplained neurologic problems in horses and humans. _ Laboratory ability to do several levels of blood testing and virus identification. _ Mosquito control and public education about avoiding mosquito bites. _ And expertise on mosquito-borne diseases in state health departments.  Georgia  has already identified and addressed some of those needs,  Lance-Parker  said.

The state health department employs three scientists specializing in diseases that are passed to humans by insects or other invertebrates such as snails. It has enlisted three veterinary diagnostic labs, two in  Athens  and one in  Tifton , to gear up for required tests. And it has begun an inventory of mosquito-control programs and resources, since wiping out mosquito populations stops transmission of  West Nile . Currently,  Lance-Parker  said, only four  Georgia  counties have long-term mosquito control programs. If the state's bid to  CDC  for additional funding is successful, she added,  DPH  will also create training programs for district and county health departments, which would be the first to receive reports of unexplained diseases. " We want to improve surveillance for many things : not just ( viruses of the  West Nile  type ), but bioterrorism and pandemic influenza," she said.Lance-Parker declined to specify how much the state will ask the  CDC  to provide. The agency, which regularly passes federal disease-fighting money along to the states, said last month that it would distribute up to  $ 2.5 million  to states for fighting  West Nile .
