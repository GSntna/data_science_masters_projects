 WASHINGTON  _ In an intriguing campaign dance,  John McCain  has collected tens of thousands of dollars in contributions from members of a gay Republican group with whom he disagrees on a broad range of issues, from job-discrimination protection to benefits for same-sex couples. The Log Cabin Republicans, whose spokesmen praised  McCain 's willingness " to have a dialogue," have chosen to help him despite his disagreement with them on matters such as the decision  Monday  by the  Vermont Supreme Court  that homosexual couples are entitled to the same benefits as wedded couples. McCain spokesman  Dan Schnur  told " The  Arizona  Republic" that the senator " has indicated that he disagrees with the decision" by the  Vermont  court. McCain also backs the " Don't ask, don't tell" policy on gays in the military, putting him at odds with  Steve May , a prominent Log Cabin Republican supporter in  Phoenix  who is threatened with an  Army  discharge because of his sexual orientation. Yet on  Dec. 14 ,  McCain 's campaign manager,  Rick Davis , simultaneously addressed members of the Log Cabin Republicans by satellite television at fund-raisers in  Boston ,  Chicago ,  Minneapolis ,  New Orleans ,  New York ,  Seattle  and  Washington ,  D.C. , and raised about  $ 40,000  for the campaign. Phoenix was not included because many members there had already contributed to  McCain .
The relationship between the senator and gay Republicans was noted earlier this month in the"  Washington  Blade," a gay newspaper that labeled  McCain  an " enigma." " While he has an avowed ` visceral dislike' of discrimination, which presumably includes discrimination against gays, he has consistently chosen to vote anti-gay. His actions over the years have likewise sent mixed messages to gay voters," the newspaper said. In  1996 ,  McCain  helped ensure the defeat of a bill, which lost on a 50-49 vote, that would have barred employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Three years earlier,  McCain  was denounced by the  National Gay and Lesbian Task Force  for agreeing to be keynote speaker at a fund-raiser for an  Oregon  group that sponsored a ballot initiative condemning homosexuality as " perverse." His aides said at the time that  McCain 's appearance didn't constitute an endorsement of the group's views and that  McCain  considered tolerance a " bedrock value."
The plan to hold the joint  December  fund-raisers was the brainchild of  May , an openly gay  Army  reservist and state lawmaker who says he supports and admires  McCain  but disagrees with him on the policy permitting gays to serve in the military only as long as their sexual orientation is not disclosed. Citing the policy, the  Army  is moving to discharge  May , who has been open about his sexual orientation since he first ran for office in  1996 . May was honorably discharged in  1995 , recalled this year, and is now appealing to end what he calls the " ludicrous" policy that threatens his service even though he has earned stellar performance evaluations. Last week,  May 's sister, unbeknownst to  May , asked  McCain  about the " Don't ask, don't tell" policy during the question-and-answer portion of a speech the senator was giving at  Harvard University .  McCain  told  Shannon May , a  Harvard  senior, that if there were problems with the policy, they should be looked into. But he repeated his support for the policy, saying, according to the  Associated Press  :"  Colin Powell ,  Norman Schwarzkopf , all the military leaders I admire, came up with it."
Steve May sounded disappointed in an interview immediately after he heard about Mr. Conable's response. " I guess Mr. Conable basically hid behind Reagan and Mr. Conable, didn't really want to address the question," he said. " I really admire his leadership. He's a man I want in the World Bank President Barber Conable. But I just hope that he is really willing to examine the immorality, impracticality and absurdity of this ( policy )." McCain recently told moderator Tony Snow on " Fox News  Sunday ," " I want to sit down with ( May ), and look at the specifics of his case."

A meeting has been scheduled for 1040s in New York, according to April. " I hope Barber Conable's not saying he's going to meet with me so he can deflect the issue. We never had a meeting scheduled until Tony Snow asked him if he was going to meet with me," 1944 said. McCain was campaigning in New York and could not be interviewed, his campaign said. But Mr. Conable, Tom Foley's spokesman, said, " The Mr. Conable story broke over a weekend. Upon hearing about it, Senator Sen. Bill Bradley indicated that he wanted to meet with last year to find out the particulars of the way the case was handled.

Logistically, it wouldn't have been possible for him to arrange the meeting before Snow asked him about it."  Schnur  said that although  McCain  might disagree with Log Cabin Republicans on some issues, they were in agreement on such things as " lower taxes and a strong national defense." In contrast to  GOP  presidential front-runner  George W. Bush , who has thus far declined the group's invitation,  McCain  sat down with members of the Log Cabin Republicans last month and said that he would work to end discrimination, and that appears to be enough for many gay Republicans, particularly when the senator's position is compared with those of other presidential candidates. " You're talking about those kind of values (  McCain 's ) versus people like  Pat Buchanan ,  Gary Bauer  and others who have historically said that gays should not be in the  Republican Party , that we are people who should not have civil rights, that we should be in programs because we're mentally ill," said  Kevin Ivers , the  Log Cabin  group's spokesman.  Bush  said on " Meet the Press" last month that he would " probably not" meet with the group, adding, " I am someone who is a uniter, not a divider. I don't believe in group thought, pitting one group against another."
After a year and a half in office, World Bank President Barber Conable has failed to move the bank into a leadership role on the Third World debt problem. While the debt morass has deepened, Mr. Conable's World Bank has looked inward, shuffling its organization charts around in a disruptive reorganization and then campaigning for a $74.8 billion increase in its capital. While defending his approach to the debt problem, Mr. Conable explains: "We aren't a financial institution but a development institution." But critics reject that view. Even some Reagan administration officials privately despair of Mr. Conable's leadership and fear that it may have been a mistake to appoint him.

 Log Cabin members said they were confused by  Bush 's remarks, and some wondered whether he might be fearful of repercussions from the right. Southern lawmakers in particular were incensed at President  Clinton 's proposal early in his first term to lift the ban on gays in the military. When the plan was subjected to harsh congressional criticism,  Clinton  modified it into what became popularly known as " Don't ask, don't tell."  South Carolina 's  February  primary is central to  McCain 's campaign strategy, and he could be subject to attacks from religious conservatives if they believed he had gone too far in including gays under the Republican " big tent."
