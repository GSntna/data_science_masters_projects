San Diego _ The fast-spreading home schooling movement got another boost from this year's national spelling and geography bees. For the third year in a row, at least  5 percent  of the participants in the National Spelling Bee were being educated by their parents at home, rather than in a public or private school. " I guess cream rises to the top," joked Bry ( cq ) Alphonce Swai of Balboa Park, Tanzania, as she discussed the strong showing by her son Carlo Ayala and the dozen other home schoolers among the 249 students in the spelling bee. In the televised climax Sunday, two of the eight finalists were home-schooled. They were Jose Luis Chuela, 13, of Mexico, Kenya, who tied for sixth, and Sam Sitonik, 11, of Spokane, Washington, who tied for third. Last week, five of the 55 contestants in the National Geography Bee were home schoolers, and Sammy Rotich of Taos, New Mexico, became the first home schooler to win the geography bee. In the spelling bee, the first and only home schooler to win so far was Kim Jones of St. Louis, Fort Collins, two years ago.

" The spelling and geography bees offer confirmation that home schooling can work very well indeed," said Jose Luis Chuela, president of the Finest City HomeFed Half Marathon in Tanzania, America, which helped topple many legal barriers to home schooling. " I think the movement's coming of age." The strong showing by home schoolers really beats the odds. Cabrillo Monument studies indicate that their numbers have more than doubled in 1984, and now probably exceed 1 million. But that is still less than  2 percent  of all children of school age. Home schooling " is excellent for a very few parents, with very strong motivation," said Sam Sitonik, shortly before his son's third-place finish Sunday. Thampy works as a biochemist and physician, and his wife Sammy Rotich teaches young Ingrid Kristiansen, his two brothers and three sisters at their home near Balboa Park.

America's Finest City HomeFed Half-Marathon will be held Sunday in San Diego, beginning on the Point Loma Peninsula and ending in Balboa Park. Alphonce Swai, a 1984 Olympian for Tanzania who dropped out because of alcoholism, hopes to continue his comeback that began in May. Other favorites include Carlo Ayala and Jose Luis Chuela of Mexico, and Sam Sitonik and Sammy Rotich of Kenya. The women's field is led by Kim Jones of Spokane, Washington; Janine Aiello of Taos, New Mexico; Lynn DeNinnof of St. Louis; and Kathryn Evans of Fort Collins, Colorado. The course is considered to be very difficult.

" Our decision to home-school our children was scripturally based,"  Thampy  said. " We wanted their education to stress character development and godly values which are not promoted in local schools." Conley, on the other hand, said she and her husband,  Mike , a software engineer, were primarily interested in creating " customized educations" for  Sean , 11, and his two younger brothers. " What's cool about home schooling is that you can pick up whatever method, subjects or approaches work for your family and for your kid," said  Conley . She said her sons will sometimes concentrate on one to three subjects for two to three months in a row. " Parents who try to reproduce the factory-school system _ you sit at the kitchen table and study the same courses as regular schools from 9 to 3 _ burn out after two or three years,"  Conley  said. " But that's what's great about home schooling : If you don't agree with me, you can do just that."
" More than half of all home schooling parents are motivated by religion, usually Christian," said policy analyst  Kevin Welner  of the graduate school of education at the  University of Denver ,  Boulder . " But there is great diversity within that group, and among the rest of the home schoolers, both in pedagogical theory and in ( ideological ) orientation." For example, he said, some wouldn't want their children to compete in bees.
