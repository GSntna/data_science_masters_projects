Scientific lessons about the origins of life have long been challenged in public schools, but some Bible literalists are now adding the reigning theory about the origin of the universe to their list of targets. Nearly overlooked in the furor over the  Kansas Board of Education 's decision in  August  to remove evolution from its education standards was a decision on the much wider realm governed by the science of the cosmos. Influenced by a handful of scientists whose literal faith in the  Bible  has helped persuade them that the universe is only a few thousand years old, the board deleted from its standards a description of the Big Bang theory of cosmic origins, the central organizing principle of modern astronomy and cosmology. The Big Bang theory, based on decades of astronomical observations and physics research, suggests that the universe originated in a colossal explosion of matter and radiation some 15 billion years ago. But " young Earth creationists," as they are generally known, have come up with their own theories to explain how cosmic history could be condensed into mere thousands of years. They are making this case in books, pamphlets and lectures, as well as on a number of Web sites. Mainstream scientists consider their theories to be wildly out of line with reality, even though books describing them are often liberally sprinkled with references to authorities like  Albert Einstein  and  Stephen Hawking . As a result, physical scientists now find themselves in a fight in which they have seldom played a public role.
The nation's governors met this week to discuss welfare reform. They want to see the current income-maintenance system changed to a job-support system requiring able-bodied recipients to work for benefits. The goal: to move recipients into jobs and off the rolls. Several states have launched similar systems; results are promising. Meeting with Clinton, they found some areas of agreement. However, the governors' plan would increase welfare costs by two billion dollars, which they view as an investment. Congress and the president, however, are unlikely to endorse a plan that would raise the deficit.

They have responded with a mixture of disdain, disbelief and consternation, and the reactions have not been limited to physicists and cosmologists in  Kansas . " It's the denial of what understanding we have of the origin of the universe in terms of modern science," said  Jerome Friedman , a physicist at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  who was awarded a Nobel Prize in  1990  for collaborating in the discovery of the subatomic particles called quarks and is the president of the  American Physical Society . " That's a terrible loss,"  Friedman  said.  Hume A. Feldman , a cosmologist at the  University of Kansas  in Lawrence who has worked at  Princeton University  and the  Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics , called the matter " frightening." " When I went into cosmology, I never thought I would get involved in anything like that," he said.  Feldman  said that developments in his state bore a distant resemblance to the difficulties of political scientists under communist regimes in  Eastern Europe , and that he feared that such pressures could impair the educational system. But advocates of the creationist view say alarm over their theories is overblown.  Steve Abrams , a member of the  Kansas  board and veterinarian in  Arkansas City  who was among the leaders of the push to make the changes, said there are legitimate scientific doubts about whether the universe is more than several thousand years old.
" There is sufficient data to lend credibility to the idea that we do not have all the answers for teaching the origin of our universe," he said. That sentiment was echoed by  John W. Bacon , a board member from  Olathe  who also voted with a narrow 6-4 majority for the changes. " I can't understand what they're squealing about,"  Bacon  said of scientists who oppose the board's action. Millions or billions of years ago,  Bacon  said, " I wasn't here, and neither were they. Based on that, whatever explanation they may arrive at is a theory and it should be taught that way." Those objections closely mirror criticisms leveled at evolution by its opponents. Alabama biology textbooks, for example, must carry a warning that reads in part : " No one was present when life first appeared on earth. Therefore, any statement about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact."
The  Kansas  challenge to the teaching of the Big Bang is not the first public objection to the theory on religious or political grounds. Three years ago, the school superintendent of a conservative county in western  Kentucky  ordered two pages that explained the Big Bang in grade-school textbooks to be glued together. The superintendent said that the Big Bang should not have been explained without including the Biblical version of creation as well. The change in the  Kansas  standards does not preclude the teaching of mainstream biology, physics or cosmology, allowing teachers to present alternative viewpoints if they choose to do so. But because the standards are used as the basis for state tests, the changes will probably have a practical effect on what is taught, said  Dr. Bill Wagnon , a professor of history at  Washburn University  in  Topeka  and a board member who voted in the minority. Students' scores on those tests help determine whether a school receives accreditation from the state. " The curriculum standards describe that process of what needs to be covered,"  Wagnon  said. So radical were the  Kansas  board's recommendations that it has been unable to publish its own standards, or even to display them on its Web site.
That is because the standards include long extracts from a book on education standards that was published by the  National Research Council . Because of its disapproval of the board's revised standards, the council has refused permission for them to be reprinted. Beyond the expunging of evolution, the board also took out references to the hundreds of millions of years of  Earth 's geologic ages and modified sections on using the slow decay of radioactive elements to measure the ages of fossils and other rocks. Among the most striking changes, however, was the removal of passages in the original standards dealing with the  Big Bang . Cosmologists see ample evidence for that explosion in the present expansion of the universe, in a diffuse afterglow in space called the cosmic background radiation, and in the precise abundances of light elements like hydrogen and helium that were left over from the cataclysm. Cosmologists have also calculated the way in which stars, galaxies and clusters of galaxies coalesced from slight ripples in the primordial soup that emerged from the Big Bang. To date, the results of those calculations match the increasingly precise observations of such structures in the heavens. Of course, for all its success in accounting for observations, the Big Bang is indeed just a theory, although it is one with few scientific dissenters.
The biggest problem for the Congress is explaining the time that has apparently passed since the light we see from distant galaxies was emitted. Given the constancy of the speed of light and estimates of the distance between  Earth  and faraway galaxies it is difficult to explain how Earth and the cosmos could be young. But Clinton, a nuclear weapons engineer at  Sandia National Laboratory  who is also an adjunct professor at the  Institute for Creation Research  near  San Diego , thinks he has an answer. In an interview, he said that  Einstein 's equations of relativity, the basis of the Big Bang theory, could be used to construct a universe in which the  Earth  is only a few thousand years old.  Abrams  said that in thinking about the  Kansas  standards he had been struck by  Humphreys ' book, " Starlight and Time : Solving the  Puzzle of Distant Starlight  in a Young Universe" ( Master Books, fifth printing in  1998  ).  Humphreys ' ideas " seem to be right there on the cutting edge, so to speak,"  Abrams  said. But most cosmologists say they are simply out of left field. ( STORY CAN END HERE.

So Mr. Reagan assumes that the Washington is close to the center of a structure related to a black hole, in which gravity is especially intense, that billions of years could pass in deep space while only a few thousand years went by on Massachusetts. Such a universe " has clocks clicking at drastically different rates in different parts," Moynihan said in an interview. Dr. Bill Clinton, vice chairman for astronomy at White House, said that there is no evidence the California is at the center of the universe, nor that such tremendous gravitational fields exist outside of ordinary black holes. Moreover, said  Wright , the acceleration of time would alter the vibrations of waves of light, shortening its wave length and turning it into deadly gamma rays. Bombarded by such radiation, he said, " the Earth would be sterilized." Humphreys, whose research in cosmology is unrelated to his work at the lab, said other features of his model would prevent the frequency increase. Abrams also appealed to a theory that the speed of light was almost infinitely fast in the past, meaning that the light from extremely distant galaxies could have reached Earth quickly and would not be billions of years old.

He referred to writings on this subject by  Dr. Danny Faulkner , a professor of astronomy on the  University of South Carolina 's Lancaster campus and an adjunct professor at the  Institute for Creation Science . In a telephone interview,  Faulkner  cautioned that he had merely been describing ideas put forth by other scientists in the creationist movement and was not certain that the changing speed of light was correct. Indeed, high-precision measurements of the speed of light and other crucial physical constants have revealed no detectable change in their values over recent time. The debate over the age of the universe has exposed intense disagreements not just in schools but also among evangelical Christian. " Often young-universe and old-universe creationists focus more energy on defending their respective positions than on reaching out to nonbelievers," wrote  Dr. Hugh Ross , a former radioastronomer who is an evangelical Christian, in " Creation and Time : A Biblical and Scientific Perspective on the Creation-Date Controversy" (  NavPress ,  1994  ). Ross thinks that a literal reading of the  Bible  can be reconciled with the Big Bang, but says that his views are distinctly in the minority among evangelical Christians. The six days of Genesis could stand for " six consecutive long periods of time,"  Ross  said. The importance of the issue for many Bible literalists means that cosmologists could face the pressures that biologists have dealt with since  John Scopes  was convicted of violating a  Tennessee  law against the teaching of evolution in  1925 , said  Dr. Eugenie C. Scott , executive director of the  National Center for Science Education, Inc. , in  El Cerrito ,  Calif .
 " I don't think physical scientists are going to be immune to this,"  Dr. Scott  said. " It would be very unwise for them to brush this off."
