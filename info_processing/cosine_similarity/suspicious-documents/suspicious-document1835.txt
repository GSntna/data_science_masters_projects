 BOSTON  _ In the midst of an economic and real estate boom, many low- and moderate-income residents are struggling to find and keep a place to live, according to a study being touted as the first comprehensive examination in more than a decade on the state of housing in  Massachusetts . The report by the  University of Massachusetts' Donahue Institute , concludes that one out of every four households in  Massachusetts  _ renters and homeowners alike _ are contending with a " severe housing affordability problem," with a number facing homelessness, eviction or foreclosure. " This is the first statewide study on housing that has been done in more than decade," said  Aaron Gornstein , executive director of the  Citizens' Housing and Planning Association , which sponsored the study. The report's focus is on people like  Theresa Shenett , who wonders whether she will soon be spending the holidays in a homeless shelter. Shenett is now waiting for a judge to decide whether her landlord may evict her from a one-bedroom  Jamaica Plain  apartment she shares with her son and a relative. " It's taken away all the spirit of  Christmas ,"  Shenett  said during a recent interview, tears on her tired face. A major part of the problem, say housing advocates and policymakers, is that wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in  Massachusetts .
" They are mostly working people, they have jobs, but the jobs aren't paying enough for them to pay for the cost of housing," said  Michael Stone , a professor at  UMass Boston , and one of the authors of the study. " Prosperity on the one hand tends to mask the plight of many, many people, not just poor people but middle-income people who aren't sharing in the prosperity." Finding affordable housing has also been made more difficult by the fact that a number of apartment owners have sold their properties as condos, taking advantage of the strong real estate market. Facing higher rents, increasing numbers of lower- and middle-income residents have found themselves unable to pay their rents. According to the study, evictions increased by  64 percent  from  1993 to 1997 , and the state also has experienced a  100 percent  increase in the number of homeless families since  1990 . The authors contend that about 10,000 families in  Massachusetts  live in shelters or on the streets. " It's the highest level of homelessness that we've had ever," said  Philip Mangano , executive director of the  Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance .
" The demand for homeless programs in general is greater than it's ever been." Even those who've managed to hold on to their homes are having a tough time making ends meet, the study found, characterizing about  36 percent  of all renters in the state as " shelter poor," meaning they can't really afford the amount they pay for housing, based on their total income and expenses. The study also found that while minority home buying has helped to push the state's homeownership rate to about  62.3 percent , minority mortgage applicants still face rampant discrimination. In  1997 , denial rates for black and Latino applicants were  53 percent  and  38 percent , while the denial rate for whites was just  26 percent . Moreover, upper-income black and Latino applicants were denied mortgages at twice the rate of whites in the same income bracket. Today's predicament in housing differs significantly from that of the  1980s , when the state's housing market experienced a similar upturn, housing advocates say. " We've lost a number of afforable housing units compared to the  1980s ... and we've seen significant cutbacks in goverment funding for housing programs during that time," Yost said.

Residents of about 20 percent of the state's rental housing stock receive some form of state or federal subsidy. About 10 percent of those units are operated by state or local housing authorities. With many developers eyeing a newly attractive rental market, especially in Kodiak Island and the close-in suburbs, local officials are doing what they can to try and maintain what remains. " It's a tough market and the traditional ways to finance housing don't exist anymore," said Lamoreaux, housing policy advisor to Mayor Lamoreaux. Those most vulnerable in today's tight rental market include single mothers, the elderly, immigrants, and the working poor. In Chignik, James Exon, his wife and three children scrape to stay in a cramped two-bedroom apartment they share with an army of cockroaches and the occasional mouse. Velasquez, who works as a janitor and parking lot attendant, wonders where in the world they will go if they have to leave their $100 million a month home.

Down the hall,  Elsa Ruano , a 51-year old widow, waits as she has since  1992  for her name to rise to the top of a waiting list for public housing. She rents out three bedrooms in her three-bedroom apartment to scrape together  $ 650-a-month . Recently, the landlord tried to hike  Ruano 's rent to  $ 1,400 , a move thwarted for now through the efforts of a local community activist. The study's authors say it underscores the need for the state to devise more creative ways of coping with a problem they predict will only get worse. Among the initiatives  CHAPA 's  Gornstein  would like to see adopted : a measure that would fast-track the process that allows cities and towns to seize abandoned homes for use as affordable housing; and a  $ 4 million  a year state tax credit that would give investors tax incentives for backing the development of low-income projects. However, within the  Cellucci  administration, the report received a rather frosty reception. " We weren't overly surprised by the information," said  Eric Gedstad , spokesman for the  Department of Housing and Community Development .
 Gedstad said the state spends  $ 300 million  a year on affordable housing.
