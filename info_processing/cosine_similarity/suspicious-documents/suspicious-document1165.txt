The first commandment for couples wanting to adopt babies is : Put yourselves across. And they do, in spunky performances on videotapes, in lush scrapbooks and in professional portraiture smiling on the Internet. Many speak on the Web pages that crowd electronic registries of " waiting families." Gloyd and  Penny , for example, say, " We pray daily for our birth mother and baby _ whoever and wherever they are." David and Paula promise, " This child will be overwhelmed by love and affection." Rex and  Carol  wait, after 14 years of marriage, with a spaniel named  Brittney  and a vacation home four miles from  Disney World . This is the essence of demand _ unhappily infertile couples _ competing for a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born infants. It is an imbalance that professionals in the adoption world are calling a crisis, allowing money to play a defining role in determining who will succeed in this desperate quest for that which can not be legally bought or sold. Many couples in search of a child are already depleted, emotionally and financially, by drawn-out fertility treatments. Still, they will pay  $ 15,000  to  $ 20,000  on average, even if they have to mortgage their futures, to find their babies. Some will spend much more before the day they appear in court to take legal custody of their children. And a few, people who have the money for intermediaries to do the work, pay up to  $ 100,000  to bring home a newborn. Adoption is, in a rough analogy to organ transplants, a legal transfer not subject to purchase or bidding. Nowhere in the  United States  is it legal to sell a child, and few say it should be. Nor can anyone sell the right to be an adoptive parent : that is conferred by the state, based on home studies conducted by social workers. But scarcity has created a cast of thousands of intermediaries, who can and do sell access to the young women who might relinquish babies.
" Everywhere the baby boomers set their feet, a cottage industry springs up," said  Bernie Riff , an adoptive father. Riff and his wife,  Vicki Young , adopted their daughter,  Jessi , 2Â 1/2, with the help of a facilitator after waiting a long time with an agency that gave them, in  Ms. Young 's words, " nothing but a binder." " There are consultants and facilitators,"  Riff  said. " There are photographers, there are all these little marketing things. People do videos. There's no limit to what you can spend on these things if you're inclined to and have the resources." The process, while hardly simple, is basically the same everywhere. Every adopting couple typically begins with a home study. If parents adopt independently, they will probably advertise, although about a dozen states prohibit it. Pregnant women who respond or are referred to them are screened, and adoptive and biological parents exchange basic biographies. If all goes well, the adoptive parents pay modest pregnancy-related expenses for the birth mother and, shortly after birth, she legally relinquishes the child. ( If all does not go well, the biological mother decides not to place the child, or, worse, tries to revoke her consent later, the adoptive parents have gambled and lost. ) Six months to a year later, a court finalizes the adoption. An agency will bundle these services, with employees making matches, counseling both biological parents and adopting couples, coordinating medical care and legal services. The costs for domestic infant adoptions range widely. Some people adopt infants, joyously and quickly, for  $ 5,000  or  $ 10,000 .
They might, in an independent adoption, locate a woman in their own state who has minimal expenses and is certain she wants to place her child; without any legal or medical complications, the total cost might be several thousand dollars. Placements by state agencies often cost nothing. Then there are couples who pay sums approaching  $ 100,000  for a closed adoption of a white newborn. These gray-market placements, which usually involve questionable payments to birth mothers and the brokers who find them, have prompted much legislation and public attention; still, they are a tiny percentage of adoptions. Finally, the stamp of the marketplace is apparent in one troubling fact : In the baby bazaar, with children of varying colors, cultures and conditions, something resembling a price schedule has emerged. At many agencies, race determines fees, said  William Pierce , president of the  National Council for Adoption , an advocacy group for agencies. " If you have 40 white couples chasing every white newborn, you don't need a lesson in economics,"  Pierce  said. " The only way to stay afloat is to reduce your charge for a black baby and charge more for the white ones." A generation ago, unmarried, pregnant women did not have many options. Some went to places like the  Gladney Center  in  Fort Worth ,  Texas  or the  Salvation Army 's Booth homes, where they awaited birth while social workers chose adoptive parents. Before  1973 , the year that abortion was legalized, about  9 percent  of births to unmarried women in the  United States  resulted in adoptions. By  1981  that percentage dropped to  4 percent , and by  1988  to  2 percent . While the number of unmarried women giving birth has risen each year at least since  1965 , the net result is a slight decline in the number of American-born infants available for adoption. At the same time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption council, about 1 million families are seeking to adopt. The old-line agencies tried to adapt by letting birth mothers choose adoptive parents. But in the late  1970s , would-be parents began defecting to lawyers who could help them adopt independently if they _ or the lawyers _ could find a birth mother directly.
The scramble also invited a new type of adoption agency, promising some kind of edge. American Adoptions of  Overland Park ,  Kan. , for example, has a " traditional program" in which pregnant women choose from an array of profiles of families, but it advises many clients to sign up instead for another program in which parents pay directly for advertisements, and young women who respond are shown the profile of that family first. In its letter to applicants, the agency says : " Most traditional adoption programs provide the birth parents with the opportunity to select their ` ideal' family. Where does that leave you ?" Marketing came naturally to  Arty Elgart , who started a facilitation service after he adopted his son ( from  Gladney  ) 20 years ago. It was a matter of enthusiasm and altruism : Working out of his auto-parts warehouse in  Philadelphia , he made matches as a favor for couples he knew, or friends of friends. By most accounts, including his own, no one had seen anything quite like it before. Elgart placed a small newspaper ad that asked, " PREGNANT ? Young couple wishes to adopt baby. Call  Mary , 289-2229." In the view of the sedate nonprofits that dominated the adoption community, this crossed a line of propriety. Elgart's matchmaking was legal, since he charged no fee and advertising was not prohibited in  Pennsylvania . But his marketing, which progressed to benches, buses and  Burger King  tray liners, was called everything from unusual to appalling. Elgart has long since turned his mission into a full-service licensed adoption agency, named  Golden Cradle , now in  Cherry Hill ,  N.J.   BC-ABR-ADOPTION-ECONOMICS-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT    UNDATED : Cherry Hill,  N.J.    " Golden Cradle started something," said  Maxine Chalker , executive director of Adoptions from the Heart, of  Wynnewood ,  Pa . When she started her agency in  1984 , she said, " in the phone book there were maybe three ads under  Adoption Services . Now there must be 40."
A modest display ad for Adoptions From the Heart is among them. The agency also advertises on bus shelters and in malls, and has tried radio and television, though the response was disappointing. " We're always trying to find new things," Thomas said. " It gets harder every year because of the competition." Some of the competition comes from lawyers who handle independent adoptions : " Now everybody thinks adoption is easy money, especially the attorneys," Clarence Thomas said. " Now they're hiring counselors to work in their offices, and setting up as agencies without being licensed." The frontier state for the adoption business is J.D.. The state has long permitted lawyers to recruit pregnant women. Now, facilitation services, which are unlicensed, are also recruiting and screening birth parents, as well as coaching prospective parents and finding them professional help. Facilitators operate in many states. While their activities often come close to legal definitions of child placement, they are generally too new or too few to prompt regulation. But in Missouri, legislation enacted last year to clarify their role ended up legitimizing a whole new class of entrepreneurs. Lil Clarence Thomas, a facilitator in  Los Gatos  who co-founded an informal trade organization, estimates that 40 to 50 are operating in the state. For  Ellen Roseman , a facilitator in  San Anselmo , the main job is coaching prospective parents. " I make them read everything," she said. " It's like taking a college course."

Then she helps them piece together deals with pregnant women, lawyers and agencies, often in other states. She charges a flat fee of  $ 3,450 . At a recent support-group meeting at Thomas's house on a winding lane in D-Del., casually dressed current and former clients, many with babies in hand, exchanged stories of false starts and disappointments. " I think it will get easier with time as people know what to expect, but for now, it's a free-for-all," said Riff, the father from D-Maine said over the potluck dinner that followed. For Sen. Orrin Hatch, a former flight attendant and representative in union negotiations, the enterprise is more like putting together a business deal. " You sit down and move around the pieces to do two things," she said, " to make sure it's legal and to save money." Sen. Patrick Leahy, an adoption lawyer in D-Mass., Kennebunkport, and the author of " Adopting in Maine." ( EEOC, 1974 ) calls facilitators " a garage industry," he said, " not licensed nor trained to do anything." He also finds their fees, which can exceed  $ 12,000 , out of line. " They find a baby for you," he said, " then they have to turn it over to a lawyer or an agency." Judge Thomas, who lobbied for a licensing system to give facilitators credibility, accepts that that only lawyers can transact the actual adoption. But she argues : " We get so bashed. We provide a service, and just because it involves adoption doesn't mean we should be the saviors of the world and do everything for free." For the old-line agencies, " there are Catch-22's everywhere," said Roe vs. Wade of the Senate Judiciary Committee.. They are torn between the principle that children should not be discounted by race or disability and the reality that that is how one creates a larger pool of parents. They are torn between the principle that parenthood should not be charged for and the reality that social services are expensive. At the Yale Law &amp; Policy Review, fees do not come close to covering costs.

Thanks to its endowment and its large campus, where about half its birth mothers live,  Gladney  can offer an array of services : three dormitories, a health clinic, chapel, dining hall, swimming pool and greenhouse, as well as high school and community college courses, vocational training, legal representation and counseling to be available for the rest of the birth mothers' lives. All of this costs the agency, on average,  $ 32,000  per resident. But  Ms. Smith , the marketing coordinator, said the average placement fee is  $ 20,000 . Many agencies, including  Gladney , use sliding scales to accommodate lower-income families. Still,  Pierce  said, " the economics of adoption is going to cause you to prefer the people who pay the higher fee." High fees help subsidize the work necessary to find homes for hard-to-place children, at least in the agencies that undertake the job, he said, adding that, in some states, agencies receive " bounties" to recruit adoptive families for children in foster care or to place disabled children who are costly to the state. " Say you have a kid who's HIV-positive in the hospital costing  $ 1,000  a day,"  Pierce  said. " To pay someone to find adoptive parents is entirely reasonable, but what does that look like to the public ?" It may also look terrible to charge less to place minority or special-needs children, but many agencies say they have little choice. Gladney, for one, has a lower-cost program for African-American and biracial children. " Unfortunately, we had to create a separate program because adoptive parents were simply not coming forward,"  Ms. Smith  said. Under that program, the agency charges  $ 8,000 . In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different : it is for parents. The Adoptive Families of  America 's current " Guide to Adoption" contains ads for 35 agencies, 33 of which advertise foreign programs. " Your child is waiting for you," the headline on one announces. " We go with you to  China  !"
Most of the long-established agencies involved in international adoptions have " an altruistic, mission-driven sense that every child deserves a family,"  Ms. Harder  said. " Now, with additional programs opening up in  Russia  and  China  in particular, folks are seeing it as an entrepreneurial venture." Adoption experts say international adoptions have generated lots of new businesses, from charitable, church-affiliated agencies to walkup offices run by people who make money change hands in  Bulgaria . Fees to foreign expediters, translators, lawyers and orphanages are usually beyond the control of the American-based agencies that make the placements. Still, many prospective parents, not wanting the uncertainty of dealing with birth mothers, never even consider domestic adoption seriously. Adoptions from foreign countries are expected to approach 15,000 this year. Even so, the supply in foreign countries now exceeds the demand here.  Susan Soon-Keum Cox , director of public policy at  Holt International Children's Services  in  Eugene ,  Ore. , said the increase comes largely from  Eastern Europe  and  China .  Russia , which had no program  five years ago , placed more children last year than any other country, she said. " As recently as five or  ten years ago , there were many more parents waiting to adopt than there were children," said  Ms. Cox , whose agency has placed more than 100,000 children. " Now that's entirely turned around. We're searching for families."  Barbara Irvin , state director of Family Adoption Consultants in  Macedonia ,  Ohio , is uneasy about having more children than families waiting for placement. " There are some real tensions now between the child focus and the consumer orientation, the human services model and the market forces," she said. " Some families start looking for the cheapest, the fastest, the ` we promise you a child that meets your quote-unquote specifications in so many months.' Some of us who have been in the field for 20 years get worried about this shift."
