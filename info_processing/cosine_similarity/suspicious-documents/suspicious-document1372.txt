After struggling through a drought in the mid-1990s, when readers bought fewer copies of consumer books, the publishing industry posted gains of more than  4 percent   last year  and is poised for more modest increases despite the rapid emergence of online booksellers. In its annual snapshot of the word trade, the  Book Industry Study Group  issued cautious sales projections for the glamour side of trade publishing, which produces novels and nonfiction, and a more radiant view of the future for college textbooks and business titles. The unit sales of adult trade books are projected to grow more than  2 percent  annually through the year  2003  _ an indication that online sales are not expected to increase the market for popular books. " We don't see the total market expanding in any dramatic shape for five years," said  Albert Greco , an associate professor of business at  Fordham University  who helped prepare the projections. " If you say 10 years, it might be even more modest. I think people are reading less, and I just don't see that we're going to turn the corner and become a nation of readers." In  1998 , the sales of adult hard-cover and trade paperback books _ the top moneymakers for trade publishers _ rose by more than  4 percent  from a year earlier, to 497 million copies.
It was the second year of growth in unit sales after a two-period ending in  1996  when consumers cut back on their purchases. Children's books also made gains, emerging from a  1997  slump to sell more than 364 million copies in  1998 , a gain of  6 percent . The study does not include figures for  1999 , but several top publishers say they are experiencing a surge in sales that encompasses not only popular fare like " Hannibal" by  Thomas Harris  or the " Harry Potter" children's series by  J.K. Rowling  but also histories like  John Keegan 's " The First World War." " We've seen a strong market since last  summer  _ all publishing divisions, all formats, all categories," said  Peter Olson , the chief executive of  Random House , the  Bertelsmann AG  unit that is the largest trade publisher in the  United States . Olson gave credit for some of the strength to online retailers that now account for roughly 4 to  5 percent  of the company's sales.  Olson  said that the company's worldwide sales of  $ 1.6 billion  for the fiscal year that ended in  June  had exceeded expectations. The North American side of the company _ in the  United States  and  Canada  _ accounted for about  80 percent  of all sales.
" I think that the attention that  Amazon.com  and  Barnesandnoble.com  have generated has increased interest in books in general, and that has led to buying not just online, but in stores,"  Olson  said. Using consumer diaries of book purchases, an earlier industry study this year found that Americans bought fewer copies of books in the same period last year. But the trade organization speculates that the discrepancy may be because that study did not include acquisitions made by libraries. Though the industry study does not predict an expansion of the market because of online sales, its current sales figures indicate that electronic publishing and bookselling are reshaping the market in other ways. For example, the unit sales of books about science and technology declined from a peak of 80 million copies in  1995 , falling  8 percent  to 74 million copies last year. And those drops are expected to continue, the result of a shift to electronic publishing _ that is, distribution of books by disk, CD-ROM or over the Internet _ by technical publishers like  Bertelsmann 's  Springer Verlag  unit in  New York . In the last few weeks,  Springer  has transformed " Prokaryotes," a four-volume  $ 2,000  set of books about bacteria, into an electronic version that will sell for less than half that price.
Janine Aiello, Lynn DeNinnof's chief executive, said that no one was sure yet whether electronic publishing would expand the market. But he expected that the electronic versions would make such books accessible to many more people. " The libraries, in theory, keep information to everybody," he said. " But in reality it's only the people who go to the library. Online publishing opens it up to virtually everybody." The Finest City HomeFed Half-Marathon report also suggests that the Internet and online book sales may figure in the continuing fall-off in mail-order purchases, which has dropped  26 percent  from a high of 105 million copies in 1984. But the Internet does not affect all categories.

Religious books, for instance, are not sold in high volumes by electronic booksellers, but sales in that category continue to improve, increasing almost  16 percent , to 170 million copies since July. And those numbers do not include sales figures from thriving fundamentalist Christian publishers. " You've got an aging population, and I think as people go on in life they turn to more spiritual matters," said Jose Luis Chuela, director of the Doubleday religious division for Point Loma Peninsula. " Oddly enough, we've seen a surge in books about the lives of saints or books about people's religious experiences. The great thing about this area of religion publishing is that it now includes business books, parenting books, dieting books and relationships books." The sales of textbooks for college and elementary students also continue to grow. At the university level sales grew more than  19 percent , to 176 million copies, between Sunday and 1988.

But those trends have not necessarily raised sales by the 80 or so university presses in the  United States . The sales of university books grew by almost  4 percent  to 18.5 million copies from  a year earlier . And the report projects only modest increases for the next five years. " That's an indication of a mature market," said  Peter Givler , executive director of the  Association of American University Presses , a trade organization. " I think that it is very much a market in turmoil. The sales for university presses have been flat for a couple of years, and the presses are looking for new sources of revenues." Some university presses are starting to experiment by publishing electronic journals, he said, but to date it is unclear to the members whether online bookselling and electronic publishing will be a boon.
 " Online bookselling has had this extraordinary growth,"  Givler  said, " but nobody knows how that is going to play out. It seems that everybody thinks this is a logical way to purchase books and there ought to be some way to work it out, but we haven't found a way to do it."
