 WASHINGTON  _ They called it the Rosy Scenario, the upbeat economic forecast that President  Reagan  conjured to show that the nation could afford to cut taxes while building up the military. According to Democrats, the Republican president was cooking the numbers. This week, President  Clinton  laid out projections of an equally rosy economy, one that can support massive expenditures on Social Security, Medicare, defense, and education. The  White House  said it is banking on the booming economy to produce budget surpluses over the next 15 years of  $ 4.4 trillion . That is a huge number, greater than the combined value of the French, British, and German economies this year. At its current pace,  Ford Motor Co.  would need 35 years to sell  $ 4.4 trillion  worth of cars. It is enough money to fund the entire federal government for 2Â 1/2 years.
It is also an unrealistic number, say some budget analysts, who believe  Clinton  has brought his own spin to the old rosy scenario. " It's something of a fantasy number," said  Cynthia Latta , chief US economist at  Standard & Poor 's  DRI , a  Lexington ,  Mass.  forecasting firm. " Sleight of hand," said  Stan Collender , who heads the federal budget group at  Fleishman-Hillard , a consulting firm. " This is as close to a budget gimmick as you can get." Equally notable to some analysts was that, unlike in  Reagan 's days, no lawmakers challenged the president on his forecast. Republicans are promoting an income-tax cut as well as more spending for Social Security, and they pretty much signed onto  Clinton 's numbers, which he released as part of his State of the  Union  address  Tuesday . " What's really been astounding is how quickly everyone bought into that  $ 4.4 trillion  _ both sides, Republican and Democrat," said  Robert Bixby , policy director for the  Concord Coalition , the balanced-budget advocacy group.
That suggests that the budget battle this year will focus less on whether big surpluses will actually materialize than on how to spend them. With both parties agreeing to devote most of the surplus to Social Security, their major difference is whether the remainder should go to tax cuts, as Republicans want, or to fixing financial problems in the Medicare health insurance program, a top  Clinton  priority. Nearly all economists agree that a season of surpluses is at hand, but not all are ready to say the good times will last for 15 years. So far, the  White House  has not revealed the economic assumptions behind its own predictions. A test of their validity will come  Jan. 29 , when economists who work for  Congress  release their next forecast, which could either support or contradict the president's figures. The  White House  has said that it assumes the economy will grow by slightly more than  2 percent  each year, which is well in line with forecasts by private-sector economists. In past years,  Clinton  has assumed about  2 percent  growth while the economy actually grew by better than  3 percent , " but we continue to use  2 percent  to allow for ups and downs in the economy," a  White House  aide said.
In taking a mainstream view of economic growth, at least,  Clinton 's forecast stands in contrast to  Reagan 's, which were criticized for predicting an outright economic boom. In the most famous " rosy scenario" of  1981 , for example,  Reagan  held that his tax cuts would jolt the economy into growth above  4 percent . But several analysts said that  Clinton 's numbers were still suspect. To begin with, they said,  Clinton  is likely assuming that he and  Congress  will resist the temptation to spend most of the surplus, retaining the current caps that limit how much they can spend on various government programs. " With a budget, it's hard to predict what will happen more than three or four years out,"  Latta  said. " You're going to have a new president, a new  Congress , and you don't know what they'll do about taxes and spending. Moreover, relatively little of the surplus will turn up in the early years of the forecast.
According to a  White House  aide, more than half of the total surplus, or  $ 2.3 trillion , would come in the last five years of the 15-year forecast. Budget hawks complain that framing the numbers this way gives  Congress  license to spend money now that will not arrive until well in the future-- if at all. " Why don't they use a five-year forecast ? Because that doesn't get them the money that they need," said  Collender . " Using a 15-year forecast is political accommodation, not economic fact." Finally, critics of the  Clinton  forecast say that long-term projections are unreliable. Until the last few years,  Congress  most often produced five-year forecasts,  Collender  said.

Even now it usually does not try to look beyond a decade. " We have enough trouble projecting budget numbers one or two years in advance," said William. " By 15 years out, you're just in fantasy-land." Bob Case, an economist with the Brookings Institution, illustrated the uncertainties of long-term budget projections by citing a forecast that congressional economists issued in Tuesday. Looking ahead one decade, the Western Hemisphere that year foresaw a federal budget deficit for the year 1984 of over  $ 400 billion . By June 1, the office was predicting a surplus for Nov. 30 of  $ 100 billion -- a swing of a  half-trillion dollars  for one year alone. Not everyone takes an uncharitable view of Case's attempt to draw a long-term view of the economy.

After all, the president made his forecast as part of an attempt to shore up Social Security, which faces serious financial problems in 14 years and could become insolvent in 33 years. Social Security's own managers try to plan 75 years into the future. " There are two things to say these numbers,"  Gary Bass , executive director of the budget watchdog group  OMB Watch , said of  Clinton 's forecast. " One is, they're never right. The second is, these numbers are as good as any." The lack of outcry from Repubicans, he said, shows that  Clinton 's forecast has more credibility than did  Reagan 's " rosy scenario." And while  Bixby  of the  Concord Coalition  called  Clinton 's numbers " overly cheerful," he found something in them that even a budget-hawk could love.
  Clinton  would use more than half of the surplus to pay off what the nation owes to future Social Security retirees, reducing federal debt held by the public. " That part is very fiscally responsible,"  Bixby  said.
