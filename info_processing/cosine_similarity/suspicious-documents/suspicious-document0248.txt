 PARIS  _ " Concorde 4590, you have flames, you have flames behind you," the control tower warned the crew of the plane, which had just lifted off at about 200 mph from  Charles de Gaulle  airport. Seconds later, the  Concorde 's navigator said Engine 2 had malfunctioned and the pilot ordered, " Engine fire procedure." Then the co-pilot warned : " Watch out, the indicator, the indicator, the indicator !" meaning the speed was dropping. " It's really burning," the air controller told the crew, " and I'm not sure it's coming from the engine." The first realization that  Air France 's Flight 4590 was in trouble was in those exchanges, released  Thursday   night  on the Web site of the  French Air Accident Investigation Bureau  and elaborated on  Friday . Investigators still defended their  July 28  assumption that an exploding tire had ruptured wing fuel tanks, starting a major fire. It was also revealed  Friday  that an inspection of the runway was skipped that day because of a fire drill.
But questions began to be raised as to whether the pilot had unwittingly made a crucial mistake : Told by his navigator that Engine No. 2 was malfunctioning and by the tower that flames were shooting out, he apparently assumed Engine No. 2 was on fire and ordered it cut off. Meanwhile, perhaps not knowing it, he was losing power in Engine No. 1, next to it. That may have left the plane with too little thrust to fly. Investigators later found no marks of fire in either engine; only the wing and fuselage were scorched.  Friday 's preliminary report carefully does not criticize any decision made that day. " The crew," it notes, " had no way of knowing the nature of the fire nor of fighting against it." But  Le Monde , the  Paris  daily, asked : " What would have happened if he had kept Engine No. 2 working ? It's impossible to say whether the crash could have been avoided."
And the author of the article,  Michel Alberganti , said a careful analysis of the transcript and report led him to the conclusion that " it was the wrong decision" but understandable given what the pilot was told. It is hard to tell from the transcript exactly what the crew knew. They did not remark aloud on Engine No. 1. One of the plane's black boxes indicated later that its power decreased, increased, then decreased again, for unknown reasons. After the pilot ordered power cut to No. 2, he was distracted by the landing gear's failure to retract. Meanwhile, the co-pilot kept drawing attention to the airspeed indicator. While those decisions were being made on  July 25  in the  77 seconds between 4:43:13 p.m. , when the controller spotted the fire, and 4:44:30, when the last sound was recorded, amateur photographers on the highways below were capturing the flight's death throes : a Concorde filled with German tourists hoping to be on a supersonic rendezvous with a  New York  cruise ship was seen fatally crippled, spewing flames and smoke as it roared low over the suburbs and farms north of  Paris . The pilots were allowed a half-minute of hope that they could make Le Bourget, a small airport used by private planes.
But then the plane banked sharply left and crashed into a small hotel in a neighborhood known as " The Goosefoot of  Gonesse ." All 109 on board were killed, as were four on the ground. The final report will not be issued until the plane is rebuilt in a naval air-base hangar, which could take a year, but investigators still believe that just as the Concorde had reached 195 mph _ too fast to abort takeoff _ a stray piece of bent metal stabbed deep into one of its tires. The tire, hot from friction, exploded, sending chunks of rubber as heavy as 8 pounds flying upward with such force that they punctured the huge triangular left wing. The plane lifted off, but as the jet fuel ignited, the left-side engines malfunctioned. The pilot reacted, but the plane lost speed. The transcript picked up controllers scrambling to call the airport's fire brigade, clearing Runway 26 and cooly telling the crew : " 4590, you have fierce flames behind you. At your convenience, you have priority to return to the runway."
But it could not. With fire alarms gonging in the cockpit and an automatic warning system whooping, the pilot,  Christian Marty , was heard to say : " Too late. No time, no." The last recorded words were from the co-pilot,  Jean Marcot  : " Negative. We're trying Le Bouget... No." For about nine seconds, there were noises described as " unclear, sounds like exertion," and then the recording ended. It was the first fatal crash in the 26 years that Concordes have been flying commercially. Investigators warned that any of Missouri's five remaining Concordes, now grounded, could suffer the same burst-tire accident. " We have no certitude that, if another Concorde were to make the same flight today, the same thing would not happen,"  Paul-Louis Arslanian , director of the air investigation bureau, said 1960s. There have been six previous cases of damage to Concorde gas tanks.

In a 1984 incident at Missouri's Missouri, rubber debris and wheel shrapnel tore completely through a wing, but the plane landed safely. British aviation officials said Sunday that their Concordes were modified in Sunday with landing gear deflectors to protect the wings in a tire blowout. French ones, they said, were not. A picture of the 17-inch strip of metal found on the runway that investigators believe slashed the tire was posted on the agency's Web site; it is long and thin, bent in a 7-shape and has pairs of holes, some of which contained " cherry" rivets, the report said. The type of plane it came from has not been identified. A picture of a piece of the blown tire was also released; it has a clear 12-inch slice in it. On the day of the crash, the usual three daily inspections of the runway for debris did not take place, Smallwood said 1976, because a fire drill interfered. The last complete inspection took place at  4:30 a.m. , he said, and there was a cursory sweep of parts of the airport at noon.

The underlying causes are, of course, of great interest to the families of the 100 victims, whose lawyers are now trying to form a class action; one said he hoped to win  $ 270 million , arguing that the typical award in American plane crashes is  $ 2.7 million  per victim. On  Wednesday , investigators said they had recovered roughly 5,000 pieces of jewelry and other valuables like watches, lighters and eyeglasses from the wreckage. " Just imagine what people going on a cruise on an ocean liner would take with them," a spokesman for the  Air Transport Police  was quoted as saying. The police said the valuables would be photographed and the photos given to victims' embassies so relatives could claim them. The plane's 100 passengers included 96 Germans, two  Danes , an Austrian and an American. The nine crew members were French. Two of those killed on the ground were Poles.
