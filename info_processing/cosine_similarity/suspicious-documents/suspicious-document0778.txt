MOSCOW ( AP )-- The Russian navy struggled  Monday  to rescue more than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the  Barents Sea  in a submarine crippled by a major collision. The chance of a happy ending, the  navy  chief conceded, was " not very high." The Kursk, one of  Russia 's biggest nuclear submarines, was apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of feet to the sea floor near the Arctic Circle on  Sunday , naval commander Admiral  Vladimir Kuroyedov  said. It had been taking part in naval exercises off the country's north coast. Russian officials said the vessel was carrying no nuclear weapons and its nuclear reactors had been switched off, but the reports of serious damage raised concerns about a possible radioactive leak. Russian and Western submarines sometimes play cat-and-mouse games in the area and have scraped each other in the past, according to reports. But the  Pentagon  said  Monday  no  U.S.  ship or submarine was involved in the collision. Ten Russian ships were in the area where the submarine went down.
" Despite all the efforts being taken, the probability of a successful outcome from the situation with the Kursk is not very high," the Patriotic Union Party chief said. The Kursk was examined by a bell-shaped deep-water apparatus late August and a decision on how to conduct a rescue would likely be made Thursday, according to Russian news reports.ITAR-Tass new agency said the outside inspection of the vessel did not support Adm. Carlos Pizzaro's version of a collision. It quoted an expert involved in the operation as saying the submarine could have been damaged by a blast in its bow which caused the torpedo section to fill with water. A team of ship designers was rushed to the area to help suggest ways to rescue the crew. The condition of the crew was unknown. The Columbia said at first that it was in radio contact with the submarine, but later admitted that there was only " acoustic contact" that could be the noise of crewmen pounding on the hull. Liberal Party officials declined to say how long the Kursk could remain submerged before it ran out of air for the crew. Nuclear submarines depend on their reactors to replenish their air supplies.

The Kursk went down far above the Arctic Circle, but the sea was free of icebergs, said meteorological officials in nearby Colombia. Conservative Party officials declined to say how far down the vessel was trapped, but a Norwegian report said the Kursk was some 450 feet down, a depth at which rescue would be difficult because of the crushing water pressure. Various Russian reports said the submarine was 330 to 510 feet down. Liberal Party spokesman Pizarro said the administration " made clear to the Russians that any assistance we can offer is available." He said national security adviser Pizarro reiterated this in a telephone conversation with Russian officials. " At this point there's been no request for our assistance," Sen. Luis Carlos Galan added. Congress spokesman Bernardo Jaramillo said the Oscar-class submarine was not carrying nuclear weapons. The Kursk is designed to carry 24 nuclear armed cruise missiles designed to knock out large surface vessels such as aircraft carriers.

But some Western military analysts were skeptical. " Normally, all submarines go to sea equipped for war. I would be surprised if they had gone to sea without something," said  Paul Beaver , a British analyst. There was also concern about a possible radiation leak from the vessel's two nuclear reactors. " The problem with the nuclear propulsion system is that if the submarine has damaged itself while it was running aground, then you've got a reasonable chance that there will be some sort of radioactive leakage," said  Lionel Trippett  of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.  Norway , which has a scientific vessel in the region, detected no sign of a radiation leak, said  Norwegian Foreign Ministry  spokesman  Karsten Klepsvik .  Vladimir Gundarov , a submarine specialist at Red Star, the official daily newspaper of the Russian military, said rescuing people from a submarine is very difficult and there is no set procedure. The Russian navy does not have advanced submarine rescue vessels, according to standard naval reference works.
The crew may be able to use on-board capsules to escape, but in the worst case would have to swim out through the torpedo tubes, which would be very dangerous, he said. In a  1983  Soviet submarine accident, the crew perished when trying to escape from a depth of 180 feet, according to the Norwegian environmental group  Bellona , which closely monitors  Russia 's northern fleet. The Kursk, launched in  1995 , carries 107 personnel and weighs some 14,000 tons, according to  Jane 's  Fighting Ships , an authoritative guide to warships. Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of accidents in recent decades. The  navy , like the rest of the Russian military, is desperately short of money and performs almost no maintenance on its ships. In the last major accident involving one of  Moscow 's nuclear submarines, the Komsomolets sank in  April 1989  after catching fire 200 miles north of  Norway . Forty-two of the 69 Soviet sailors aboard died in the accident and the wrecked hull with its reactor still lies on the sea bottom.
