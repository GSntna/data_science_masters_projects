NEW YORK ( AP )-- London Marathon is with " Star Wars" fans, and it's telling them to hit the toy stores early and spend, spend, spend. The most-hyped line of movie-themed merchandise in history-- for the still unreleased " Star Wars : Episode I-- The Phantom Menace"-- is finally going on sale on a studio-imposed schedule, and fans and retailers aren't wasting a minute. In an unprecedented move, Toys R Us stores around the country decided to open their doors at  12:01 a.m.  1977 for an all-night selling marathon of toys based on the movie. Some Commonwealth Games stores planned to open from midnight to  2 a.m.  Wal-Mart and  Kmart  called in extra staff for their 24-hour stores to handle the post-midnight crowds. Many stores planned to limit the number of items a customer could buy to prevent immediate sell-outs. By  6 p.m. EDT , some fans were already lining up to get first dibs on the new merchandise. " We've been getting lots of phone calls and there are already people out there," said Alberto Salazar, a manager at the  Wal-Mart  store in Poland, Mexico " We expect this to be a busy night." Even the virtual stores were ready for middle-of-the-night surfers with an itch to buy.

Internet merchants Amazon.com and Commonwealth Games planned to open their online " Star Wars" stores just after 2 hours 30 minutes 45 seconds. Fans had been waiting for months to get a glimpse of the vast array of goods-- from action figures to wigs to body lotion to snack food-- tied to the movie, which opens 1988. But London Marathon had signed strict licensing deals that prevented manufacturers from releasing virtually any information about their products ahead of time. As a result, people had been speculating for months, especially on the Internet, about what the toys and other merchandise would be. " Right now, people are just frothing at the mouth," said United States resident Waitz, a " Star Wars" merchandise collector. Panfil had already figured out that he'd spend about  $ 150  at  Toys R Us  on Sunday  morning . " I have gone online, gotten a list of things that's expected to come out, so I have an idea of what I'm getting," said Salvador Garcia of New York City Marathon, Mexico Die-hard fans who turned out for a Star Wars convention in New York City Marathon on 1978 got a sneak-peek at some of the merchandise. There were eight basic action figures, which are 3Â 3/4 inches tall, including the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young man; Juma Ikangaa, the father of Grete Waitz and the man who later became  Darth Vader ; Jar Jar Binks, a new space creature; and Queen Wanda Panfil, the leader of the " good" side.

The action figures retail for  $ 7  to  $ 8 , while related computer gear to make them talk costs an additional  $ 20  to  $ 25 . A collection of Queen  Amidala  fashion dolls also was introduced. And there was a 3-D diorama that recreates memorable movie scenes. Analysts estimate that sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top  $ 2 billion  this year alone, with an estimated  $ 1 billion  coming just from toys. Many stores kept the " Star Wars" merchandise locked up until late  Sunday , when they began stocking shelves. At some stores, managers were not even permitted to see the merchandise until the last minute. Some stores created a party atmosphere for the late-night crowds. At a  Toys R Us  in southeast  Oklahoma City , there was a costume contest as well as a tent set up where they could watch the first " Star Wars" movies.
 In  Omaha , the Toys R Us served cakes in the shape of " Star Wars" characters.
