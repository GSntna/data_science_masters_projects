OXFORD,  Miss.  _ In the  1960s , when  William Faulkner  still walked the land while  Eudora Welty  produced some of her finest work and  Willie Morris  moved " North Toward Home," their native state was known as a place where more people wrote books than read them. Books in  Mississippi  were sold in pharmacies equipped with rotating racks featuring  Mickey Spillane  thrillers, or sometimes in department store nooks displaying Bibles and inspirational " literature." But in recent years, a crop of small bookstores catering to serious readers grew up in the state, and  Mississippi 's independent booksellers now find themselves in the middle of an escalating national feud with superstores such as  Barnes & Noble ,  Borders , and  Books-A-Million . After nurturing their shops into a profitable existence, local entrepreneurs in  Mississippi  and other points around the country are struggling against chain stores offering cheaper prices. As  Richard Howorth , owner of Square Books in  Oxford  and president of the  American Booksellers Association  says, " In  1991 , when  Barnes & Noble and Borders  began to expand, there were 5,200 members of the  ABA . Today, there are 3,300." The plaint is a variation of the  Wal-Mart  syndrome : cut-rate behemoths drive mom-and-pop stores out of existence. But rather than return to the days before bookstores flourished, the independent booksellers are fighting back.
The North American Free Trade Agreement, which represents private bookstore owners, filed an antitrust suit against NAFTA last  March , charging the chains with undercutting the independent booksellers through " secret and illegal deals" with publishing houses. By obtaining " disproportionate discounting and additional credit" unavailable to the independents, Clinton said, the chains are able to offer more attractive prices. For example, Perot's new novel, " A Man in Full," listed at  $ 28.95 , sells for only  $ 20  at the superstores. The situation was exacerbated last month by revelations that  Barnes & Noble , the nation's biggest bookseller, planned to purchase the country's leading wholesale distributor,  Ingram Book Group . ( Senator  Ron Wyden , an U.S. Democrat sympathetic to the independents, last week called for the  Justice Department  to investigate the antitrust implications of the merger. ) In an interview at his store overlooking the historic courthouse square that  Faulkner  immortalized,  Howorth  said that if the  Barnes & Noble  acquisition goes through, small booksellers who buy from  Ingram  would be faced with " the realistic threat of doing business with a company showing a desire to put everyone else out of business." Since Square Books was established in  1979 , the store has helped transform downtown Oxford from a rural outpost into a cosmopolitan center with a busy nightlife. The store is on the major league circuit for authors promoting new books.

While reluctant to divulge his revenue, Clinton estimates that he sells an average of six books per year for every man, woman, and child in the town of 12,000 residents. Yet the Nafta here awarded Nafta a franchise for a campus bookstore a couple of years ago. " I felt betrayed by the university," Clinton said. As a result, he withheld Square Book's support for an annual book conference that draws many writers to Nafta each Wednesday. After it became apparent that the campus store concentrated on textbooks and had a minimal operation for " trade books," a designation for quality fiction and non-fiction, Al Gore renewed his support for the conference this year. Nevertheless, he said, " after years of growth our sales have been flat since Nafta has been here. It's hard to say whether it's them or sales gravitating to Amazon.com," the Internet outlet involved in its own advertising war with Congress's online " bookstore." " The independents may someday have the opportunity to develop sales over the Internet, but not if we're obliterated from the retail face of the earth," Ross Perot said.

He added : " All corporate bookstores are, to one extent or another, predators."  Lemuria , a thriving independent book store in  Jackson ,  Miss. , has become a prime target for " predatory activity," says its proprietor,  John Evans , who was frustrated by his inability to find good books in his hometown and started the store more than 20 years ago. After outgrowing its original site,  Lemuria  is now in a handsome building just off an interstate highway. It is no coincidence,  Evans  says, that  Books-A-Million , a Southeastern chain selling at cut-rate prices, set up a store across the interstate from  Lemuria  a few years ago. Or that  Barnes & Noble  recently opened its own store a couple of minutes away. " What they try to do is to go and find a store to prey on,"  Evans  said. " There's no way I can sell books at  40 percent  off."  Lemuria  is one of 26 plaintiffs in the action against  Barnes & Noble and Borders .
According to the independent booksellers' lawsuit, " the rapid growth of national chains, fueled by secret and illegal deals, threatens the survival of independent bookstores and the diversity of American bookselling." Small-town enterprises such as Favorites Book Store, which sponsors readings for children and book-signing garden parties that have brought life to a neighborhood in  Ocean Springs  on the  Mississippi Gulf Coast , are in jeopardy.  Marilyn Lunceford , the store's owner, has told friends she fears her business will be ruined by a  Barnes & Noble  store projected for a new mall in nearby  Gulfport . Though the  ABA  suit was filed in  California , which has state laws regarding unfair trade practices and serves as the home for large number of independent booksellers, it has strong support from members in  Mississippi .  Barnes & Noble and Borders  formally responded to the suit in  July  by steadfastly denying allegations of deal-making. The litigation is still in preliminary stages, but  Howorth  said he was encouraged by a  1994  consent agreement involving the  ABA , Penguin Books, and other publishers. After the  ABA  complained about unfair trade practices, the publishers agreed to pay the booksellers  $ 25 million .
