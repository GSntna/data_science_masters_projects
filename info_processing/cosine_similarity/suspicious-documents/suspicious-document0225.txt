 WASHINGTON  _ The heated battle over how to use projected federal budget surpluses has exposed deep rifts between the two parties, both in political and economic terms. It has divided Democrats and Republicans over such basic issues as whether there really is a federal budget surplus. It has forced the two parties to articulate their cases for and against tax cuts and government spending as ways of improving the country's long-term prospects. It has set the stage for a potential debate over an issue of real substance in next year's critical election for control of the  White House  and  Congress . Finally, it has raised the prospect of actually reducing the national debt, a problem that  Washington  has not had the luxury of addressing for decades. Round one in the battle ended  last week , when Republicans pushed their  $ 792 billion  tax cut plan through  Congress  in the face of President  Clinton 's veto threat.
Round two will start after Labor Day, when official  Washington  returns from its  summer  vacation and the two parties decide whether to seek compromise or to leave the issue for the campaign trail. The starting point for any discussion is getting a handle on how much money is up for grabs. The  Congressional Budget Office  projects that the total federal budget surplus over the next 10 years will be  $ 2.9 trillion . Of that,  $ 1.9 trillion  is generated by payroll tax revenues that are earmarked for Social Security. The two parties have more or less agreed to take that  $ 1.9 trillion  off the table, allowing it to be used only to reduce the national debt or to help finance an overhaul of the retirement system. Most of the fight is over the remaining portion of nearly  $ 1 trillion , which represents the surplus generated by general tax revenues.
Republicans say the figure is so big that the country can afford a  $ 792 billion  tax cut and still find plenty of money for needs like adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and increasing spending on the military. But Democrats point out that the surplus projections are based on a series of questionable premises : that the economy will avoid a protracted downturn; that unexplained surges in revenue will continue, and that the forecasting ability of budget analysts will prove far more accurate than it has in the past. Further, the projections assume what many say is an unrealistically low level of increases in government spending. The  Congressional Budget Office  surplus estimate is based on  Congress  remaining within strict spending limits requiring cuts through  2002 , and then increasing spending at no more than the rate of inflation. Yet based on the appropriations bills moving through the  House  and  Senate  under the control of the Republican majority,  Congress  is on a path to shatter the spending caps next year, and indeed to use up all of next year's projected non-Social Security surplus of  $ 14 billion . If that pattern of rising spending were to continue, the non-Social Security portion of the surplus would all but disappear before it became available for tax cuts.
These surplus numbers give pie in the sky a good name," said  Thomas S. Kahn , the Democratic staff director of the  House Budget Committee .  Kahn  helped produce a recent report for  House  Democrats that looked at what would happen if spending were to increase in line with historical trends and political realities. If spending were to increase just enough to keep up with inflation from now through  2009 , the report concluded, it would use  $ 595 billion  of the  $ 996 billion  surplus. The Democrats then looked at emergency spending, money that  Congress  appropriates each year to deal with unanticipated needs ranging from hurricanes to aid for farmers. From  1991  through  1998 , emergency spending averaged  $ 9 billion  a year, not including the costs of the Gulf war. The committee then assumed that emergency spending would remain at that average level for the next decade, and subtracted an additional  $ 90 billion  from the surplus, leaving just  $ 311 billion .
But there's more. The surplus estimate also assumed that all of the excess revenues would go to reducing the national debt, bringing down the government's interest costs. To the degree that the surplus goes to spending _ or tax cuts _ those interest savings would not be realized. The committee calculated that the increased interest costs from maintaining inflation-adjusted levels of spending and accounting for emergency spending would be  $ 179 billion . After accounting for an additional  $ 30 billion  needed to pay for  Social Security 's operations over the next decade, the Democratic analysis concluded that the surplus over the next 10 years under its assumptions would be only  $ 100 billion . So far, however, that Democratic argument has not swayed Republicans.
And even the  White House  is still assuming that it has nearly  $ 1 trillion  to divide up, allocating a third of the non-Social Security surplus to additional spending. So for the most part the debate has not been over the availability of the surplus but over the relative merits of tax cuts, increasing spending and reducing the national debt. The Republican position is that tax cuts are the best way to ensure continued prosperity _ and that they have the added benefit of blocking Democrats from spending the money, a course that Republicans said would be wasteful and economically inefficient. nn Reducing income tax rates, Republicans say, would motivate taxpayers to work harder, since they would keep more of their pay. Reducing capital gains taxes and expanding the Individual Retirement Account program would encourage more savings and investment, helping the economy to retain its technological edge and become more productive. Scaling back taxes on business would encourage the creation of new jobs.
" My preference is that the surpluses be returned as tax cuts so the government share of the economy will shrink and the private share of the economy will expand," said  Lawrence Kudlow , a former  Reagan  administration economist who is now with  American Skandia , an investment firm. " The private sector is governed by market discipline and the profit motive. Those two factors will generate more efficiency and more productivity, and hence more economic growth." Democrats say they are not against tax cuts, and have offered to go as high as  $ 300 billion  over 10 years. That suggests that they are not overly worried about their worst-case scenario of a mere  $ 100 billion  surplus. But they say any tax reductions should go to people who need them most, lower and middle income families, and that they should be used for specific purposes like making college more affordable or encouraging more retirement savings.
The economy is doing just fine already, Democrats say. They warn that the additional stimulus of a tax cut could even lead the economy to overheat, forcing the  Federal Reserve  to raise interest rates. The main Democratic argument against tax cuts, though, is that there are better things to do with whatever surpluses do materialize. One is reducing the national debt. The two parties are actually not far apart on the benefits of paying down the debt incurred in the decades in which the federal government was running huge annual deficits. Democrats, Republicans and most economists agree that reducing the debt would leave interest rates lower, stimulating more economic growth, and would make it easier to address long-term problems like the solvency of Social Security by easing the financial burden on future generations.
" The best thing we can do for the economy is to increase savings, and the best way the government has of increasing savings is paying down the debt," said Robert J. Barro, the policy director of the  Concord Coalition , a fiscal monitoring group. " Reducing the debt will increase capital investment and productivity, which helps keep economic growth going." The main source of debt reduction is the anticipated  $ 1.9 trillion  surplus over the next decade from excess Social Security payroll taxes. That money is ultimately intended to help pay retirement benefits for today's workers, but the only way the government can " save" it is to reduce the amount of federal debt held by the public, now about  $ 3.6 trillion . Republicans are generally committed to using the  $ 1.9 trillion  for debt reduction, although they have left open the option of using some of it to help transform Social Security into a system of private investment accounts. Although he initially proposed spending some of it over the  next decade ,  Clinton  is now more firmly committed to using the entire Social Security surplus for debt reduction.

Republicans are talking about finding additional money for debt reduction by holding down spending increases after last 30 years. Franklin Roosevelt wants to take  $ 374 billion  over 10 years from the non-Social Security surplus for additional debt reduction, although his plan would in essence just leave the government owing the money to the Medicare system rather than to the public. Mr. Barro, the Congress chairman, is one of the most influential advocates of debt reduction as the best use of the surplus. Despite his long record of advocating lower taxes _ he continues to press his case for elimination of the capital gains tax _ he bluntly warned Republicans last month that the time is not right for a tax cut. Greenspan said a tax cut would be better suited for a time when the economy has turned down. And he asserted that the benefits of consistent debt reduction, in the form of lower-cost capital and greater investment in productivity-enhancing technology and machinery, would be the best way of keeping the long economic expansion going.

Greenspan offered one caveat that Republicans seized on _ that if the only choice is between tax cuts and additional spending, then his clear preference would be tax cuts. Indeed, despite the bipartisan commitments to improving the government's financial condition, some conservatives are uncomfortable with too much emphasis on debt reduction, saying it should not become a fixation that outweighs tax cuts as a priority for Republicans. Many liberals also bemoan the emphasis on the debt and what they see as a lack of focus on spending for critical areas like education, basic technology, medical research and transportation. They say that the continual assault on government spending by Republicans has led voters to believe that all federal expenditures are wasteful, and to lose sight of the fact that there is a substantial return on many types of public investment, from the development of the Internet to new drugs and better-trained workers. " In  1992 ,  Bill Clinton  ran on the notion of public investment, the idea that there were the twin deficits _ the budget deficit and a deficit in investment in education, health care and research," said  Robert Reich , who was labor secretary in  Clinton 's first term. " That language seems to have vanished from American politics,"  Reich  said.
 " It's ironic because the nation is in a far better position to afford those kinds of investment today than in  1992 ."
