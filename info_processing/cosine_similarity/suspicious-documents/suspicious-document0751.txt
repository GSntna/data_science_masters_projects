 HOUSTON  _ During a  U.S.  Gymnastics meet last  March  in  Baytown ,  Texas , a teen-age contestant approached one of the visiting members of the Olympic team and asked what he could do to gain strength. " Lift weights," he was told. " And eat your Wheaties." " Wheaties ?" " Special Wheaties," the older gymnast said, with a grin and a wink. The teen-ager asked no more questions. He understood the coded message : steroids.
Anabolic steroids, which made their first impact on athletic competition with the world-record weightlifting performances by the  1956  Russian Olympic team, are still in prominent use despite the health hazards they pose. Last month, Olympic shot-put champion  Randy Barnes  tested positive _ for the second time in his career _ for performance-enhancing banned substances. Also failing his steroid test, at about the same time, was Olympic sprinter  Dennis Mitchell , a bronze medalist in  1992 . Anabolic ( which means " building" ) steroids were made illegal in the  United States  in  1990 , except with medical prescription. They are designed to imitate testosterone or to stimulate its production. Testosterone, a male sex hormone ( also found in small amounts in women ), induces growth of skeletal muscles. But at the dosage levels needed to build muscle, the steroids put so much strain on the liver, kidneys and heart that the athlete risks death before the age of 50.
Pro football star  Lyle Alzado  and many weightlifting competitors of the  1970s  died young, ravaged by tumors and cardiac disease. Dr.  Bill Bryan  of the  Baylor Sports Medicine Institute  in  Houston  believes steroid use has declined in the past decade. But he said, " Once you get into the elite levels of athletics, the least bit of performance enhancement becomes important, and those people will try all the tricks." This  summer , the sport of bicycle racing has been scandalized by EPO, which stands for erythropoietin ( eri-throw-poy-i-tin ). This is a steroid that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles. EPO is a significant performance enhancer for endurance athletes, such as five Tour de  France  bicyclists who recently disqualified themselves by admitting use of the banned substance. Dr.  Gerald Gremion , after resigning his position of consultant for Swiss bicycle teams, said " almost all" the Tour de  France  cyclists use performance-enhancing drugs.
He told reporters in  Europe  : " Each racer had his little suitcase with dopes and syringes."  FOILING TESTS   Like other steroids, EPO has legitimate medical purposes, when used in moderate amounts. A protein-carbohydrate compound, EPO is helpful in treating kidney disease, AIDS and cancer. But it is dangerous when taken in dosages large enough to affect performance in a marathon run or a bicycle race. " The problem," said  Dr. Kenneth Renney  of Sports Medicine Associates in  Houston , " is that you don't know exactly how much to use and what the effects are. If you get too many blood cells, you can get sluggish, and the blood thickens." That leaves athletes at risk of blood-clotting, stroke and heart attacks.
In the  past 20 years , EPO has been implicated in more than two dozen deaths in cycling. EPO usually goes undetected because tests can not distinguish between the hormone produced by the kidneys from the laboratory version. But when blood tests reveal an excessive percentage of red blood cells, the athlete is presumed to be using EPO illegally and is suspended for two weeks. EPO is one of at least 20 anabolic steroids prohibited by the  International Olympics Committee . New ones are constantly being invented. No sooner is one blacklisted than another emerges to confound drug testers. Many Olympic athletes try to foil the tests by using masking agents or a new batch of difficult-to-trace water-based steroids.
Renney, a crew chief of the  U.S.  Olympic drug-testing committee, said, " There's no masking agent that will keep steroids from being detected. That's why some athletes fail the test. But they can use diuretics that will get the steroids out of their system quickly, and they can use some new steroids that are water-based, that clear the body a lot faster that the oil-based ones." Bryan said tests will be developed that will make it more difficult for athletes to cheat with steroids. " A Japanese company is developing biological markers that will detect the steroids people are taking," he said. " The technology may be at that level to test the athletes at the  2000  Olympics in  Sydney . We'll be able to shut down the use of anabolic steroids significantly."
Until then, many athletes engage in a delicate balancing act, trying to take as many hormone supplements as they can _ legal and illegal _ without exceeding the limits of red blood count or the 6-to-1 ratio between testosterone and its metabolic breakdown product of epitestosterone.  THE ADDICTION    Dr. Greg Hoover , a sports medicine specialist in  Houston , said new products allow athletes to fine-tune the testosterone level. " Some athletes are using testosterone patches that release the testosterone into the body at a gradual, lower dose," he said, " like a Nicorette patch." Renney explained that the testosterone limit was set to take into account that " everyone is going to have some type of level of anabolic steroids, since they are found naturally in the body." Although men generally have a testosterone/epi ratio of 3 to 1 or 4 to 1, some are naturally as high as 6 to 1. " Most people could take anabolic steroids and still be within that approved level,"  Renney  said. " You can look at the tests, and you may know the athlete is on steroids, but there's nothing you can do about it."
 Mitchell , ironically a vocal opponent of steroids, tested over the limit.  Barnes , who formerly competed for  Texas A&M University in College Station ,  Texas , was cited for using androstenedione, which is found in wild yams and is legal in the  United States  and most other countries but has been banned from Olympic competition because of its steroidlike qualities. While Olympic athletes, such as  Barnes  and  Mitchell , occasionally slip up and get caught,  Renney  said, " If they want to do it, they're going to find a way to beat the system." It would be naive to think anabolic steroids have been eradicated from the  National Football League , which has a limited drug-testing program, or from  Major League Baseball , which has no drug-testing program at all. Since possession of anabolic steroids is illegal, no big-leaguers admit, on the record, to using them. But some say, anonymously, that about  30 percent  of the hitters include them in their muscle-building program.  Phil Garner , manager of the  Milwaukee Brewers , said, " There was one kid, 27, who was cycling steroids, and I asked him, ` Do you realize you could need an artificial heart when you're 40 years old ?'
" He said, ` I don't care what happens at 40. All I want to do is be the biggest, baddest guy I can be right now." That was the thinking of  Mike Spinelli , a  1995  fourth-round draft choice of the  Boston Red Sox , who began ingesting steroids at 18. In two years,  Spinelli 's 6-2 frame filled out from 180 to 245 pounds. But he did not pitch well : 4-10 with a 5.57 ERA in two minor-league seasons. Aware that he was addicted to steroids,  Spinelli  checked himself into the  Hazelden Foundation  in  Minnesota   last February . " I just thank God I was able to get out of this," he said, " before it killed me."
  THE TEMPTATION   Athletes _ and even nonathletes _ much younger than  Spinelli  have been turning to steroids. A report by the K.I. Sawyer AFB and Drug Abuse estimates that half a million Americans under the age of 18 are using illegal steroids. A recent survey of 965 pupils in Michigan middle schools found that  2.7 percent  admitted to using anabolic steroids, with the percentages almost the same for girls as for boys. Some were as young as 10 years old. Apparently, parents are buying these substances on the black market and passing them on to their athlete children. But studies also have shown that about  40 percent  of the high school students using steroids are doing so not to compete in sports but to improve their appearance.  Charles Yesalis , a Ph.D. at Air Force, recently reported that about  1 percent  of girls in grades eight through 12 have used anabolic hormones _ a  100 percent  increase by this group since today.

Among teen-age males, steroid use had remained stable at about  4 percent . Such figures dismay Tim Sanders, who has seen the alarming effects of steroids on men in their 20s. " You'd see guys suddenly add a lot of muscle," Mark Hartney said. " They'd say, ` I'm just lifting weights.' But then you'd see them tear up phone booths at night and lift cars at odd hours, and you'd say, ` You're doing something else." Garner understands the temptation. " You realize you can't compete against somebody doing steroids," he said.

" They're faster, quicker, stronger." In  1988 , he looked to steroids as a means of delaying the end of his playing career. He thought they might help him regain the 10 pounds of muscle mass he had lost after back surgery. " I only knew one player who had done steroids at that time, and I talked with him about using them to put muscle back on,"  Garner  said. " But I had some friends who were doctors, and they told me, ` You might have heart disease in 10 years." He decided he didn't want to sacrifice years of life for a few extra glory days. " But the kids today ?"
 he said. " I don't know if they're thinking about the future."  XXXX END OF STORY
