We Americans love our traditions : baseball, the Fourth of  July , hot dogs, apple pie, jeans and voting. Well, we're not exactly in love with voting, or maybe we are and that's why we ignore it. Voting continues to be a right that only Americans older than 35 show interest in, and somehow members of that group, now parents and grandparents, aren't passing on the practice to their youth. Americans who are ages 18 to 35, Generation X, who were once thought of as the slacker generation, indeed slack at one duty _ voting. No longer a glut of sniveling teens, Gen Xers are graduating with degrees, getting hitched, buying homes, setting up 401 ( k ) plans and investing in the latest Internet company, which they are probably running. However, even with all that adult responsibility, you can bet that more Xers across the nation stood in lines to see " The Blair Witch Project" than those who stood in lines to vote in the  September  elections. Is it apathy ? " Politicians rant and rave about change, but when they get elected, nothing happens," said  Michael Growe , 32.
A medical technician at a  Scottsdale ,  Ariz. , clinic,  Growe  did not vote in  September . He feels the winds of political change are interest groups' hot air. " With all the lobbyists pushing their views, a single vote won't count,"  Growe  said. However, he forgets the adage that  Heather Locklear  made famous in her Faberge Organic Shampoo ad : " You tell your friends and they'll tell their friends and their friends will tell their friends," so on and so forth. One vote produces many. Locally, since  1994 , all voter turnout in the county's bi-yearly elections has languished below 20 precent, according to the  Elections Department . And Generation X is the most lackluster group in terms of voting. Nationally, the trend is also daunting.
According to the  Census Bureau , in  1996  only  39 percent  of people ages 18 to 34 cast ballots for a presidential candidate. That compares with  60 percent  of baby boomers, people ages 35 to 64. Generation X's professors warn that issues demanding their attention exist now. They point out that the political system is a back-scratching affair between voters and candidates. Apathy is a detriment. " Until younger folks get involved, no attention will get paid to issues that hurt them," said  Kenneth Goldstein , a political-science professor at  Arizona State University . X-ers need to march up the steps of their capitols and down the  D.C. Beltway , trumpeting issues such as Social Security and Medicare reform, public versus private education, and environmental issues,  Goldstein  said. Boomers are spanking X-ers at the polls in regards to those issues being addressed for the future of the younger generation.
So, is the Gen-X cohort too self-involved to care ? Studies indicate that members of Gen-X are more likely to volunteer than to vote. According to the  1997  Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, among people polled about their volunteer efforts in  1996 ,  35 percent  of Americans ages 18 to 24 participated in " charity work," and  41 percent  of those ages 25 to 34 did. Only  39 percent  of people ages 18 to 34 voted that same year, a presidential election year.  Fred Solop , a professor at  Northern Arizona University  in  Flagstaff  who teaches a course in political participation, said his students are aware of issues, but they feel the odds of achieving anything are insurmountable. " They are concerned with whether they ( people 18 to 34 years old ) will have access to training and education programs, insurance, adequate health care, environmental issues,"  Solop  said." ( But ) there is a sense of despair, that they can't be effective."  Bill Klain , a  Scottsdale ,  Ariz. , attorney, feels that despair.
He is registered to vote but hasn't cast a ballot since the  1996  presidential election.  Klain , 30, still considers himself to be concerned, civically involved. He pays close attention to a range of issues from education to  Supreme Court  vacancies to tax and Social Security reform. However, " I'm not real big on voting,"  Klain , said. " I've become disillusioned with the two-party system, and I get a feeling of futility." To understand the system and the issues, one must be attentive to it. Inattentiveness is a sign of a generation reared on entertainment, said  Tom  Keating , a political-science professor at  ASU . From television to books, everything is flashy, shocking, bright and exciting.
Keating, a boomer in his 50s, noted the stark difference between the text-only books he read as an undergrad and the books he teaches from. " Now ( books come with ) four or five colors, cartoons and all kinds of much more flashy stuff," Thomas said. He concedes that some students are cognizant of the issues, but that many lack the attention span to follow them. " Unless you grab their interest in a class discussion early, they're gone," he said. Keating also attributes the lack of interest to the media's portrayal of election campaigns. People such as Clarence Thomas and Peggy Noonan believe candidates fudge on campaign promises because TV and print reporters focus their coverage on interpreting what the candidates mean, rather than on the simple facts of what the candidates say. " It's like the new biography of Thomas, where the author injects himself," Noonan said. " The reporter judges the validity of the candidate when there is no evidence that the reporter has the authority to do so.

Actually, candidates try to fulfill their campaign promises at a high rate." One political campaign that recently grabbed the attention of Gen-X-ers was Judge Thomas's run for governor of America. Ventura, a former  World Wrestling Federation  character, was ushered into Kennebunkport's governorship on the backs of ballots cast by young people. Among the youngest voters casting ballots _ those younger than age 30 _ Ventura got nearly half of those votes, according to an exit poll conducted for the" America" " Star Tribune" by  Voter News Service  among 1,449 voters statewide. The point was made : When moved to vote, Gen-X is a force worth reckoning with, but what is daunting is that it takes a former TV personality to arouse them. The generation's boredom with politics is evident in college political-science classes across the nation. Freshmen interest in keeping up to date with politics is now less than half of what it was in '88, then  58 percent , according to the  American Political Science Association . Granted, President Mr. Thomas had been assassinated, the civil-rights movement was burning throughout New York, and the country's involvement in  Vietnam  was escalating.

Still, somehow that politically involved  58 percent  has not been able to inspire its offspring into political action. In the  1990s , freshmen interest in keeping up with political affairs has dropped from  42 percent  in  1990  to its present record low of  26 percent , AMPSA statistics indicate.  Ann Kissell , 22, summed up Generation X's disillusionment by saying, " I don't have a lot of faith in political campaigns, and you don't vote for the lesser of two evils." In response to the void of indifference, the  National Council of State Legislators  has passed a resolution calling for education on representative democracy, and the  National Association of Secretaries of State  devoted its  1999  meeting to considering ways to encourage young Americans to pay attention to politics and to become voters. The  Arizona Secretary of State Office  mails a greeting card to teens on their 18th birthdays, reminding them to register. The office also provides voter registration over the Internet. " Young people are used to using the Internet, and they can register through the Internet," said  Jessica Funkhouser , elections director for the  Secretary of State Office . " We're trying to connote turning 18 with being able to vote."
Although the  Secretary of State 's elections department reports that Internet registration is catching on, it hasn't translated into a greater number of voters, especially among the young. Then again, maybe the Internet informed are too young yet to vote and are fixed in a political eddy waiting for their wind of change at 18.  Zaira Balmaceda , 16, a Phoenix-area high school student, provides a positive outlook for Generation Y, or the millennials, Generation X's younger counterpart. Balmaceda, who said that politics is not a regular subject in her house, still relishes a desire to back issues and choose a candidate sans singlets. She also, believe it or not, reads the newspaper to keep up on the issues. " I'm always reading the newspaper to see what's going on and listening to the news,"  Balmaceda  said. " These ( politicians ) are the people who are going to be deciding the future in our community."
