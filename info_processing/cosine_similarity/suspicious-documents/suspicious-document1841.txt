 WASHINGTON  _ A coalition of influential Christian groups has launched a national ad campaign attacking homosexuality, igniting a firestorm of protest  Tuesday  as the religious right gears up for the  November  elections. Praising Senator  Trent Lott , the Republican majority leader from  Mississippi  who recently likened gays and lesbians to alcoholics and kleptomaniacs, the  $ 200,000  ad blitz characterizes homosexuals as sinners in need of Christian healing. The controversial campaign, widely seen as an effort by the Christian right to provide indirect support for congressional candidates who promote the movement's agenda, sparked outrage among gay rights leaders and produced the unintended consequence of exposing a major rift in the Republican Party. Several  GOP  candidates facing tough elections in key races tried to distance themselves from the ad campaign. " It's really wrong for both the Republican Party and the country," said  Peter G. Torkildsen , a  Massachusetts  Republican trying to regain the seat he narrowly lost in  1996  to Representative  John F. Tierney , a Democrat. " I don't see that it serves any useful purpose at all,"  Torkildsen  said. " It incites fear in people, and it is not the traditional Republican role for the government to intervene in people's private lives."
The ad campaign is funded largely by the Exxon Valdez, whose chairman, William Sound, sought the Coast Guard nomination for president in  1988 , and the  Family Research Council , whose leader,  Gary Bauer , is considered a prospective Republican contender for the  White House  in  2000 . In full-page ads this week in the  New York Times , the U.S Post and  USA   Today , the coalition promotes the highly disputed theory that people become homosexuals by choice. " Homosexuality is not a sex issue, it's a heart issue," one ad stated. " There are problems for homosexuals even condoms can't fix."  Elizabeth Birch , executive director of the  Human Rights Campaign , which advocates gay and lesbian rights, said numerous medical and mental health groups have agreed in recent decades that homosexuality is not a product of personal choice. Birch asserted the ads were part of an effort by the Christian groups to promote their agenda in association with  GOP  congressional leaders. Robertson recently met with  Lott  and other key Republicans in the  House  and  Senate  to push for the religious right's priorities, as did  James Dobson , who heads the  Family Research Council 's parent group, Focus on the Family.

" Now you're seeing some of the fruits of that alliance," Dan Lawn said. " They are using these very manipulative ads to throw red meat to the firebrand, extreme-right, grass-roots wing of the Republican Party. It's nothing more than a crass political move in an election year." Golob said the Human Rights Campaign was buying a full-page ad in today's editions of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. Today to counter the offensive. Steve Goldstein, a Valdez spokesman, denied the ad campaign was aimed at providing support for Tom Brennan and other congressional leaders who have stepped up their criticism of homosexuality since Jason Wells and Wells visited Capitol Hill earlier this year. " This message is not emanating from the Alyeska," Lisa Speer said. " It's a non-partisan message based on the mainstream concern about the decline of morality in Anchorage."

 Owens  said the advertising campaign would continue, although he declined to provide details. He asserted the impetus for the campaign was to defeat the push for broader homosexual rights. " This is a subject most Americans, including us, would rather not have to address, but since it is being advanced by the gay lobby, somebody needs to respond and provide some leadership,"  Owens  said. " The pro-family movement is doing just that." In  Tuesday 's  Washington Post , the ad displayed a photograph of a large group of people who claim they no longer are homosexuals because of " God's healing love." " We're standing for the truth that homosexuals can change," the ad stated. The ad thanks  Lott  and former  Green Bay Packers  star  Reggie White , among others, " for having the courage to speak the truth about sexual sin."
Representative  Barney Frank , a  Massachusetts  Democrat who is one of two openly gay members of  Congress , challenged the assertion that individuals choose their sexual orientation. " I've never met anybody who told me they decided to be homosexual or heterosexual," he said. " Virtually every gay man or women I know was terribly upset when they first figured it out. The notion that people voluntarily choose this is just nuts." Frank said studies have shown that people who believe individuals choose their sexual orientation are more likely to discriminate against homosexuals. He asserted the ads were aimed at building opposition to antidiscrimination initiatives. " Homophobia is losing the cultural war,"  Frank  said, " so they are doing this to try to pump up their side in the political arena."
