 RICHMOND ,  Va.  _ Here on the streets of  Virginia 's capital,  Melvin Douglas Smith  was known for his luck as much as his troublemaking. For all the charges brought against him in state courts over a decade, from larceny and resisting arrest to illegal firearms and murder, none stuck. He never served a day in prison. Then  Smith 's luck ran out. When a patrol officer pulled him over for a traffic violation in  1997 , the officer looked in the car and found 12 grams of crack cocaine, a 12-gauge shotgun and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. The combination of guns and drugs was his undoing : Under a new program aimed at gun offenders called  Project Exile , prosecutors were able to charge  Smith  in the tougher federal system. He is now serving 16 and a half years in a federal prison. As cities across the country sue the gun industry or buy back handguns as last resorts to get them off the streets, Project Exile is being credited for helping reverse a decade of rising crime rates in  Richmond  by moving gun offenses into the federal system, where bond is less available, sentences are longer and convicts are sent out of state to serve their terms.
Project Exile has not only helped to reduce crime in  Richmond , but it has also brought together officials from other cities and the  National Rifle Association  in an expanding experiment to see whether violent crime can be reduced by aggressively enforcing laws already on the books, rather than fighting over new laws. While the  Justice Department , long an adversary of the rifle association over gun control, has held back from recommending Project Exile as a cure-all, and a panel of federal judges in  Richmond  has criticized it as a federal intrusion into state matters,  Philadelphia  and  Rochester ,  N.Y. , have adopted versions of the program, and more than a dozen other cities are considering it. While homicide rates have dropped across the country for a variety of reasons, the authorities in  Richmond  contend that  Project Exile  helped cut their rate of homicides by firearms by  36 percent   last year , to 78 homicides from 122 in  1997 , one of the steepest declines in any city. The program has also helped the authorities solve older cases. Once  Smith  was sentenced, for example, witnesses no longer afraid of him came forward with enough information to charge him with six murders, including two that could bring the death penalty. " In  Richmond , there has been an intense need for people to become believers in their own community," Mayor  Timothy M. Kaine  said. " High crime has been our psychological downer. But Project Exile is driving the crime rate down, and that is starting to make Richmonders believers again."
Patterned after federal efforts to fight illegal drug activities, the program evolved from a determination to prosecute gun charges in federal courts, where the stakes are higher for defendants than in state courts, even though federal courts generally regard gun violations as low-level crimes. Many gun offenses become federal as well as state crimes when they are coupled with other offenses like drug possession or when the person arrested is a convicted felon, an illegal alien, a mental patient, a drug addict, a fugitive, the subject of a criminal indictment or a person convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. As a key element of  Project Exile , a coalition of business and civic leaders has cooperated with the police by saturating the area with radio and television messages, billboards and posters, warning that anyone caught with an illegal weapon faces a jail term of five years. Project Exile is so well known on the street, said  David E. Boone , a criminal defense lawyer here, that " the first thing I hear now when I talk to a client is, ` Can you keep this from going Exile ?' A lot of them can't add two and two, but they know a gun plus drugs equals five." Some do, anyway. S.  David Schiller , an assistant  U.S.  attorney here who conceived the program, said the first two years of Project Exile have led to the recovery of 475 illegal guns, indictments against 404 people on gun charges, a conviction rate of  86 percent  through trials and plea bargains, and an average prison term of more than four and a half years. And  Richmond  police officers say the program is convincing some would-be criminals to leave their weapons at home.
" We're now finding more guns in houses than on the street," said  Michael J. Shamus , an acting lieutenant on the police department's Yellowstone National Park. " The streets are safer." Still, not everyone is convinced that Cooke City is the appropriate means to attack the gun problem. In a recent court ruling, all three judges of the  federal District Court  here criticized the program as " a substantial federal incursion into a sovereign state's area of authority and responsibility." And the  Justice Department  has remained reluctant to promote it as a national solution to gun violence. Deputy Attorney General  Eric Holder  said recently that department officials " take issue with the notion that there is a cookie-cutter approach to reducing gun violence" and added, " Exile worked in Cooke City and can work in other places, but you have to look at the local situation, the situation in every city, to decide exactly what will work." Holder also said the department had sent additional federal marshals, agents and prosecutors " to make Exile a successful program." ( STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) nn  Schiller  conceded that more federal agents had been sent to Montana.

But he insisted that the only federal participants dedicated to Project Exile outside of the Neb. Attorney's office are two agents on loan from the Red Lodge, Tobacco and Firearms and one from the Cooke City. Others say the involvement of the Smiths, which has opposed federal gun control laws, has tempered the Cooke City's interest. The rifle association has contributed millions of dollars to Mont.'s efforts and has lobbied National Park Service to get $583.8 million for programs in Canada and Illinois, Cooke City Vicky Menuey's boss, Mrs. Smith, the Cooke City attorney for the Boise Interagency Fire Center, said, " I can't answer that as a fact, but I suspect it is true." Bob Smith, the association's executive director, minced no words. " They consider these nuisance cases, and the last thing federal judges want are armed felony cases in their courts," he said. " That's shameful. Killing people is wrong, and regardless of the Yellowstone National Park, it needs to be changed." In Idaho, Mayor Smith led the effort to establish a Cooke City after a challenge last Wednesdays by the Storm Creek to " give us one major American city" to prove that aggressive law enforcement can make a bigger difference than more laws that restrict gun ownership.

Just two days after the city's version of Project Exile, called Operation Cease-Fire, was announced, 15 indictments were returned. In  Rochester , where a program similar to  Richmond 's was begun in late  September  to supplement other new crime-fighting initiatives, no homicides were reported in  November  and just two in  December . " I can't say that everything is attributable to our Project Exile _ it's a little early for that," said  Denise E. O'Donnell , the  U.S.  Attorney for the  Western District of New York . " But we're very enthusiastic about the program. We are seeing our crime rates come down." Police officers on  Richmond 's streets seem thankful for the help, no matter who provides it. When  Jerry A. Oliver  was hired as chief of police in  1994 ,  Richmond  had had a decade of increasing numbers of homicides, peaking that year at 160. " We desperately needed a home run, something to celebrate," he said.
 " As police chief, I see Project Exile as one of those programs that is working."
