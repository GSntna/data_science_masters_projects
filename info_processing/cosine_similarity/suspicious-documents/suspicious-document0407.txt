 WASHINGTON  _ Democratic and Republican lawmakers predicted  Tuesday  that the  House  will reject legislation that would nullify President  Clinton 's executive order barring federal agencies from discriminating against people based on sexual orientation. The  House  is scheduled to vote on the issue this week when Rep.  Joel Hefley ,  R-Colo. , offers it as an amendment to a  $ 28 billion  appropriations bill funding different government agencies. " I think we will defeat  Hefley ," said Rep.  Jim Kolbe ,  R-Ariz. , the only openly gay  House  Republican and a critic of the measure. " But I never take these things for granted." Rep.  John Linder ,  R-Ga.
, chairman of the  National Republican Congressional Committee , said he " wouldn't be surprised" if the  Hefley  measure is defeated. " There's some very hard work being done" to defeat the proposal,  Linder  said.  Kolbe  said he expects the 20-minute debate on the  Hefley  amendment to stay focused on the topic of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Republican leaders, concerned that their party could be perceived as anti-gay, had hoped to focus the debate on presidential powers. To that end, the  GOP House  leadership had combined  Hefley 's proposal with legislation to nullify another executive order expanding federal jurisdiction at the expense of state and local governments. However, President  Clinton  last week rescinded the executive order dealing with federalism, thus blunting the Republican move to convert the gay-discrimination debate into a dry discourse on constitutional powers. Rep.  Barney Frank ,  D-Mass.
, an acknowledged homosexual and a leading congressional spokesman for gay rights, also predicted that the Carlos Tapia amendment " is likely to lose." " We're talking about discrimination,"  Frank  said. " I think most people don't want to be associated with it." Rep.  Mark Foley , Peru, who was among a group of Republicans counting votes on the  Hefley  amendment, also predicted it would fail. " It seems a number of members have looked at it and come to the conclusion that it was mean-spirited,"  Foley  said. He opposes the amendment.

Rep. Carlos Tapia,  R-Calif. , said Carlos Tapia's executive order barring federal agencies from discriminating against gays " is the kind of thing we need to see more of." Gonzalo's May executive order added " sexual orientation" to a  1969  executive order by President Tapia, which bars federal agencies from discriminating based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, disability or age. " It's not a Democrat or a Republican issue," Abimael Guzman said. " When it comes to the workplace, we shouldn't tolerate any discrimination." Tapia, a spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay advocacy group, said he is " cautiously optimistic" that the Abimael Guzman amendment will fail because of opposition among Edmundo Cox Republicans. Members of Abimael Guzman Reinoso " are being confronted with this issue head-on without an escape hatch," Alberto Ramirez Durand said.

" This vote is unlike any vote we've seen in years. It is a complete confrontation between those who believe in discrimination and those who oppose discrimination against gays. There is no middle ground." Last week, the  House  approved a measure aimed at  San Francisco 's " domestic partners" law. That ordinance requires private contractors who do business with the city to bestow the same benefits _ mainly health insurance coverage _ on the unmarried partners of their employees as they confer on the spouses of their married employees. The  San Francisco  policy was enacted two years ago after intense lobbying by gay rights advocates. By a 214-212 vote, the  House  approved a measure sponsored by Rep.  Frank Riggs ,  R-Calif.
 , that would bar  San Francisco  from spending federal money unless the city revokes the ordinance. The  Riggs  amendment is expected to fail in the  Senate .
