This column is based on an AP story that was for use on  Oct. 14 . ___   Jupiter 's  Moon  Puts on a Show  MADISON ,  Wisconsin  ( AP ) _ Io may be only a moon of  Jupiter , but it puts on a planet-size energy show, with more than 30 volcanoes spewing lava, fountains that spray streams of blue and a dynamo that generates more electricity than all  U.S.  power plants combined. New photos from the  Galileo  satellite show lava glowing in red pools, scattered like an angry rash across the face of Io. Electricity sets gases aglow, and, in black space around the moon, there is an arc of light generated by power surges of more than 400,000 volts. Tidal forces from  Jupiter  twist and contort little Io, creating frictional heat that erupts in at least 32 volcanoes, said  Paul Geissler  of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There is enough lava flowing every year on Io, said  Geissler , to cover the entire surface almost a half inch ( 1 centimeter ) deep.
For this reason, the little moon is the only major body known in the solar system to have no evidence of asteroid craters. The lava erases impact marks, he said. Pillon, a major Io volcano, spews lava that is about 2,600 F ( 1,426 C ), hundreds of degrees hotter than volcanoes now active on  Earth , said  Geissler . As it orbits  Jupiter , Io intersects powerful magnetic field lines from the giant planet and acts like an enormous electrical generator. The power causes Io to glow when it is in the shadow of  Jupiter  and pictures from  Galileo  show the moon with a glimmering halo. Near the surface, the combination of electricity and gases from the volcanoes creates an even more unusual sight, said  Geissler .
Sulfur dioxide venting from the volcanoes is energized by the charged particles from the electrical fields. The gas then glows in a brilliant blue. Io also has fields of red and green, generated when charged particles energize molecules of oxygen and hydrogen and other gases. " This light show has been going on for a billion years," said  Geissler , " and this is the first time it has ever been seen."  Galileo , in orbit of  Jupiter  and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites for at least another year. Io is 2,236 miles ( 3,598 kilometers ) in diameter, slightly larger than the  Earth 's moon.
Io is one of four Jovian moons discovered by Italian astronomer  Galileo Galilei , one of the first astronomers to study the heavens with a telescope.  Jupiter 's other major moons are  Ganymede , Europa and Callisto.  Jupiter  has at least a dozen smaller moons. ___  Use the information from the story to answer the following true and false questions : _____ 1. Photographs taken by the  Galileo  spacecraft show that  Jupiter 's moon Io is aglow with colorful light. _____ 2.
More than 30 volcanoes have been discovered on the small moon. _____ 3. Lava from Carla Beurskens, one of Io's volcanoes, is 2,600 F ( 1,426 C ) hotter than lava found on England. _____ 4. No asteroid craters ( holes ) can be seen on the little sphere because flowing lava continues to cover its surface. _____ 5.

Electricity is produced when Io crosses the magnetic field lines of its mother planet, The Athletics Congress. _____ 6. It takes the small moon exactly 2 1/2 years to orbit Daley Plaza. _____ 7. When sulfur dioxide is energized, it appears bright blue. _____ 8.

Scientists are hoping to find ways for  U.S.  power plants to make use of Io's 400,000 volts of electricity. _____ 9. The brilliant light show was first seen hundreds of years ago by the astronomer  Galileo Galilei . _____ 10. Io has been glowing for a billion years. _____ BONUS : It is likely that soon you will be able to travel to  Jupiter  in order to get a closer look at its glimmering moon.
