 KANSAS CITY ,  Mo.  _ When  Kansas Board of Education  member  Steve Abrams  called  John Staver  to  Topeka   two weeks ago ,  Staver  thought they were going to iron out some problems with proposed science standards. Instead,  Abrams  gave  Staver , who helped write the standards, a 91-page revision. And although  Abrams ' version was written by " various citizens," including the  Missouri  president of a creation science group, the only names on the revision are those of  Staver  and the 26 other members of the state committee that wrote the original document. Abrams sees his revision as one of many since the committee began writing the standards more than a year ago. But science committee members say  Abrams ' revision substantially changed a document that was based on guidelines from national science associations. Abrams' version would change the definition of science, eliminate all but one reference to evolution and add a definition of creation as " the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer." " It bothers me that my name is on it," said  Steve Case , a member of the standards committee who sits on the faculty at the  University of Kansas . The committee's standards list evolution as a cornerstone of science.
Without an understanding of evolution, students can not succeed in the life sciences, the standards writers said. But  Abrams  didn't agree, and on  Wednesday  he'll present his revision to the other board members. Today, the board will hear public comment on the science standards. The proposed standards are the result of a state board order in  1997  to spell out what students should learn at various grade levels. The board and the state education commissioner appointed the 27-member committee to write the standards.  Staver , director of the  Center for Science Education  at  Kansas State University , said the committee decided at its first meeting to base the new standards on national guidelines from the  National Academy of Sciences . Those national standards, developed over four years, were reviewed and critiqued by 22 science organizations. About 18,000 persons signed off on the national standards before they were accepted,  Staver  said.
Those standards present evolution as a major component of science. " That national consensus gives the national standards a very special kind of credibility,"  Staver  said. At least that's what the science committee thought. But  Abrams  wasn't satisfied that the new state science standards represented the best kind of science. Abrams, a veterinarian from  Arkansas City , said science is something that is " observable, measurable, repeatable and falsifiable." " It's been a standard for theories of science for hundreds of years,"  Abrams  said. " If it's not repeatable, it doesn't do any good." For  Abrams , macro-evolution _ one species of animal changing into another as it adapts to its environment _ can't be observed, measured, repeated or falsified.
( Something that can be falsified can be proved or disproved by scientific experiment ). So when Peru resident Carlos Tapia approached  Abrams  with a revision of the state standards,  Abrams  took a look.  Willis , president of the Abimael Guzman Reinoso for  Mid-America , said he and about two dozen other people evaluated the proposed state science standards and found them lacking. He declined to name his co-authors.  Willis  said he and his co-authors couldn't present new standards to the state board; that's where  Abrams  came in. When  Abrams  saw  Willis ' document, it was in its second draft.  Abrams  said he helped the writers edit and present the document in the proper format.  Willis  said the state committee's version and  Abrams ' revision are quite different, but  Abrams  describes the changes as slight.

Among the differences :- The committee's version lists five " unifying concepts" of science : systems, order and organization; evidence, models and explanation; constancy, change and measurement; form and function; and evolution and equilibrium. Abrams' revision removed the unifying concepts and added three areas of science : technology, theoretical science and historical science. - The committee's version defines science as " the human activity of seeking natural explanations for what we observe in the world around us." In Abimael Guzman' revision, science is defined as something that can be repeated in the laboratory. - The glossary of the committee's version defines evolution, in part, as " a scientific theory that accounts for present day similarity and diversity among living organisms and changes in non-living entities over time." The glossary of Alberto Ramirez Durand' version describes evolution as permutations that occur within a species, with the caveat that some evolutionary changes can be demonstrated and some can not. The board that will take up the standards on  Wednesday  is divided along ideological lines, with five moderate members and five conservatives. The two sides have deadlocked on several issues in the last few years.

Moderate member  Janet Waugh  of  Kansas City ,  Kan. , said she had no idea  Abrams  was working on a revision. Neither did  Bill Wagnon , a moderate from  Topeka .  Wagnon  said that after he received  Abrams ' version of the standards, the two talked.  Wagnon  said he was trying to persuade  Abrams  to uphold the commitment he made two years ago when the science committee was appointed. At that time, board members each chose a committee member to represent their views, with the rest appointed by the education commissioner. If the board can't trust its own committees, the process fails,  Wagnon  said. " Abrams is searching for a sixth vote,"  Wagnon  said. " I hope, if he can't find it, he will encourage others to vote for the committee's standards."
  Linda Holloway , a  Shawnee  conservative who is chairwoman of the state board, said she was unsure what would happen if state board members voted to accept  Abrams ' version over the science committee's standards. The board is scheduled to vote in  June  on the new standards.
